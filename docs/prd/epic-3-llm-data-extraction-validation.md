# Epic 3: LLM Data Extraction & Validation

**Epic Goal:** Transform raw OCR text into structured invoice data using OpenAI GPT-4 with the default schema extraction, implement comprehensive cost tracking for all LLM operations, and establish the validation framework that ensures extraction accuracy. This epic delivers the core intelligence that differentiates CIRA from simple OCR solutions, providing structured, verified invoice data with full cost transparency.

## Story 3.1: OpenAI GPT-4 Integration Setup
As a **system integrator**,  
I want **secure and efficient OpenAI GPT-4 API integration**,  
so that **the system can perform intelligent data extraction from OCR text with proper authentication and error handling**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Configure Azure OpenAI service connection with secure API key management
2. Implement GPT-4 client with structured output mode for consistent JSON responses
3. Add rate limiting and request queuing to handle API limits
4. Create prompt templates for invoice data extraction with examples
5. Implement API response validation and error handling
6. Add request/response logging for debugging and cost tracking
7. Configure timeout handling and retry logic for API failures
8. Create connection health monitoring and alerting

## Story 3.2: Default Invoice Schema Implementation
As a **data extraction system**,  
I want **a comprehensive default schema for standard invoice fields**,  
so that **I can extract consistent, structured data from diverse invoice formats**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Define default schema with fields: vendor_name, vendor_address, invoice_number, invoice_date, due_date, total_amount, subtotal, tax_amount, line_items
2. Create TypeScript interfaces for schema validation and type safety
3. Implement schema-based prompt generation for GPT-4 extraction
4. Add field validation rules and data type checking
5. Create confidence scoring for each extracted field
6. Implement fallback handling for missing or unclear fields
7. Add schema versioning for future enhancements
8. Create schema documentation and field definitions

## Story 3.3: LLM Data Extraction Processing
As a **processing pipeline**,  
I want **intelligent data extraction from OCR text using structured prompts**,  
so that **I can convert unstructured invoice text into reliable, structured business data**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement LLM processing step in Step Functions workflow ("extracting_data" state)
2. Create extraction prompts that specify output format and field requirements
3. Add OCR text preprocessing to improve LLM extraction accuracy
4. Implement structured output parsing and validation
5. Add extraction quality assessment and confidence scoring
6. Create error handling for malformed or incomplete extractions
7. Implement extraction result storage with original text reference
8. Add processing time and token usage tracking

## Story 3.4: Cost Tracking and Attribution System
As a **business operator**,  
I want **detailed cost tracking for all LLM processing operations**,  
so that **I can monitor processing costs per job and maintain profitable pricing**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Track GPT-4 token usage (input and output tokens) for each job
2. Calculate real-time processing costs based on current OpenAI pricing
3. Store per-job cost data in database with timestamp and breakdown
4. Implement cost accumulation and reporting by time periods
5. Add cost alerting for jobs exceeding expected thresholds
6. Create cost optimization recommendations based on usage patterns
7. Implement cost API endpoints for client billing and transparency
8. Add cost forecasting based on processing volume trends

## Story 3.5: Extraction Validation and Quality Control
As a **quality assurance system**,  
I want **comprehensive validation of extracted invoice data**,  
so that **clients receive accurate, reliable structured data with quality indicators**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement data validation rules for extracted fields (format, range, consistency)
2. Add cross-field validation (e.g., subtotal + tax = total)
3. Create confidence scoring algorithm combining OCR and LLM confidence metrics
4. Implement data quality flags (high, medium, low confidence)
5. Add validation error reporting and human review flagging
6. Create quality metrics tracking and reporting
7. Implement extraction result comparison with original OCR text for verification
8. Add quality improvement recommendations based on validation results
