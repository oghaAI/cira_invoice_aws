# Epic 4: API Completion & Production Readiness

**Epic Goal:** Complete the API with comprehensive error handling, authentication, monitoring, and production deployment capabilities. This epic transforms the processing system into a production-ready service with enterprise-grade reliability, security, and observability that customers can depend on for their business-critical invoice processing workflows.

## Story 4.1: Comprehensive API Error Handling
As an **API client**,  
I want **clear, actionable error responses for all failure scenarios**,  
so that **I can handle errors gracefully and understand what corrective actions to take**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement standardized error response format with error codes, messages, and suggested actions
2. Add specific error handling for invalid PDF URLs, unsupported formats, and processing timeouts
3. Create error categorization (client errors, server errors, external service failures)
4. Implement error logging with correlation IDs for debugging
5. Add retry guidance for transient errors vs permanent failures
6. Create error documentation with examples and resolution steps
7. Implement graceful degradation for partial service failures
8. Add error rate monitoring and alerting thresholds

## Story 4.2: Production Authentication and Authorization
As a **system administrator**,  
I want **secure API key management and usage tracking**,  
so that **I can control access, monitor usage, and implement billing based on consumption**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement API key generation with secure random generation and hashing
2. Add API key validation middleware with rate limiting per key
3. Create API key management endpoints (create, revoke, list, usage stats)
4. Implement usage tracking and quotas per API key
5. Add authentication error handling with clear security messages
6. Create API key rotation mechanism for security best practices
7. Implement request attribution for billing and usage analytics
8. Add API key expiration and renewal notifications

## Story 4.3: Production Monitoring and Logging
As a **system operator**,  
I want **comprehensive monitoring, logging, and alerting**,  
so that **I can maintain system reliability and quickly diagnose issues**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement structured JSON logging across all services with correlation IDs
2. Create CloudWatch dashboards for key metrics (processing time, success rates, costs)
3. Add application performance monitoring with custom metrics
4. Implement log aggregation and searchability for debugging
5. Create alerting rules for system health and performance thresholds
6. Add business metrics tracking (jobs processed, revenue attribution)
7. Implement log retention policies and cost optimization
8. Create operational runbooks for common issues and responses

## Story 4.4: Final API Endpoints and Documentation
As a **developer integrating with CIRA**,  
I want **complete API documentation and all necessary endpoints**,  
so that **I can successfully integrate invoice processing into my application**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Complete GET /jobs/{id}/result endpoint with extracted invoice data
2. Implement GET /jobs/{id}/cost endpoint for processing cost transparency
3. Create comprehensive OpenAPI documentation with examples
4. Add API versioning strategy and backward compatibility
5. Implement pagination for job listing and history endpoints
6. Create SDK examples in popular programming languages
7. Add API testing tools and sandbox environment access
8. Implement API usage analytics and performance optimization

## Story 4.5: Production Deployment and Infrastructure
As a **DevOps engineer**,  
I want **production-ready deployment automation and infrastructure**,  
so that **the system can be deployed reliably with proper monitoring and scaling**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Create production deployment pipeline with automated testing gates
2. Implement infrastructure as code for all AWS resources
3. Add database migration automation and rollback capabilities
4. Create backup and disaster recovery procedures
5. Implement auto-scaling configuration for Lambda functions and database
6. Add security scanning and vulnerability assessment automation
7. Create production environment monitoring and health checks
8. Implement deployment rollback mechanisms and blue-green deployment strategy
