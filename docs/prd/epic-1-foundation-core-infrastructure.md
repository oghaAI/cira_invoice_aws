# Epic 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure

**Epic Goal:** Establish the foundational AWS infrastructure, database schema, and basic API endpoints that enable job submission and status tracking. This epic delivers a working system that can accept invoice processing jobs, store them in the database, and return job status - providing immediate testable value while laying the groundwork for all subsequent processing capabilities.

## Story 1.1: Project Setup and Repository Structure
As a **developer**,  
I want **a properly configured monorepo with TypeScript, testing framework, and AWS CDK setup**,  
so that **I can develop, test, and deploy the invoice processing system efficiently**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Initialize monorepo structure with packages for API, database, and shared utilities
2. Configure TypeScript with strict compilation settings and shared tsconfig
3. Set up Jest testing framework with coverage reporting
4. Configure AWS CDK for infrastructure as code deployment
5. Implement ESLint and Prettier for code consistency
6. Create GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD pipeline
7. Document development setup and deployment procedures in README

## Story 1.2: AWS Infrastructure Deployment
As a **system administrator**,  
I want **core AWS infrastructure provisioned and configured**,  
so that **the system has the foundation services required for invoice processing**.

### Acceptance Criteria  
1. Deploy PostgreSQL RDS instance with appropriate security groups
2. Create API Gateway with basic CORS configuration
3. Set up Step Functions state machine skeleton for workflow orchestration
4. Configure Lambda functions for API endpoints with proper IAM roles
5. Create CloudWatch log groups for structured application logging
6. Deploy Redis ElastiCache instance for job status caching
7. Verify all services are accessible and properly networked
8. Document infrastructure components and connection strings

## Story 1.3: Database Schema and Models
As a **backend developer**,  
I want **a complete database schema for job tracking and results storage**,  
so that **I can persist job data, status, and processing results reliably**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Create jobs table with fields: id, status, pdf_url, created_at, updated_at, completed_at
2. Create job_results table with extracted data, confidence scores, and cost tracking
3. Create api_keys table for authentication and usage tracking
4. Implement database migration system using TypeORM or similar
5. Create TypeScript models and repository patterns for data access
6. Add database indexes for performance on job status queries
7. Implement connection pooling for Lambda function database access
8. Create database seeding scripts for development and testing

## Story 1.4: Basic API Endpoints
As an **API client**,  
I want **fundamental endpoints for job submission and status checking**,  
so that **I can submit PDF processing jobs and monitor their progress**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement POST /jobs endpoint accepting pdf_url and returning job_id
2. Implement GET /jobs/{id}/status endpoint returning current job status
3. Add basic input validation for PDF URL format and accessibility
4. Store job submissions in database with "queued" status
5. Return consistent JSON response format with error handling
6. Add request/response logging for debugging and monitoring  
7. Implement health check endpoint for system monitoring
8. Create basic API key authentication middleware

## Story 1.5: Job Status Management System
As a **system operator**,  
I want **reliable job status tracking and state management**,  
so that **clients can monitor processing progress and the system maintains data integrity**.

### Acceptance Criteria
1. Implement job status state machine: queued → processing_ocr → extracting_data → verifying → completed/failed
2. Create status update functions with database transactions
3. Add job timeout handling for stuck or failed processes
4. Implement Redis caching for frequently accessed job status
5. Add status change logging and audit trail
6. Create status validation to prevent invalid state transitions
7. Add job cleanup mechanism for old completed jobs
8. Implement status polling optimization to reduce database load
