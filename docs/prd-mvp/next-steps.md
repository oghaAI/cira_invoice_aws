# Next Steps

## MVP Implementation Phases

**Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)**
- ✅ Build core API infrastructure
- ✅ Database and basic endpoints working
- ✅ Job submission and status checking

**Phase 2: Processing (Week 3-4)**  
- ✅ Step Functions workflow operational
- ✅ Docling OCR integration working
- ✅ Text extraction and storage

**Phase 3: Intelligence (Week 5-6)**
- ✅ OpenAI GPT-4 integration
- ✅ Structured data extraction
- ✅ Complete end-to-end processing

## Architect Prompt
This MVP PRD is aligned with the simplified architecture document. Key implementation guidance:

1. **Start Simple** - Use the minimal tech stack defined in architecture
2. **No Over-Engineering** - Stick to basic error handling and logging  
3. **Focus on Happy Path** - Get the core workflow working first
4. **Direct SQL** - No ORM complexity, use direct database queries
5. **Basic Testing** - Focus on integration tests for critical path

The MVP can process invoices end-to-end in 4-6 weeks, providing immediate customer value while establishing foundation for iterative enhancement.

**Success Criteria:**
- PDF URL → structured JSON data in <2 minutes
- 95% success rate on standard invoices  
- Cost transparency with token tracking
- Simple API that "just works"

Build this MVP first, learn from real usage, then add complexity based on customer feedback and proven need.
