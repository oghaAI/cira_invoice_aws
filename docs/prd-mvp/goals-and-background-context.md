# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Process 3,000 invoices/day (90,000/month) with 95% accuracy using scalable 3-step workflow
- Reduce manual processing from 15-30 minutes to under 2 minutes per invoice
- Handle peak loads of 125+ invoices/hour with auto-scaling architecture
- Provide cost-transparent API-first solution optimized for enterprise volume
- Build the simplest thing that could possibly work at scale, then iterate

## Background Context
CIRA MVP addresses enterprise-scale invoice processing: converting 3,000+ daily PDF invoices to structured JSON data reliably and cost-effectively. The system targets mid-to-large organizations requiring high-volume processing without the complexity of enterprise software.

Built with scalable AWS serverless architecture (API Gateway + Lambda + Step Functions + PostgreSQL with auto-scaling), CIRA MVP handles enterprise volumes while maintaining simplicity. The 3-step workflow provides immediate value for high-volume customers while establishing foundation for iterative enhancement.
