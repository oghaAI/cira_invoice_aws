# Next Steps

## Architect Prompt
This MVP architecture is ready for immediate development. Key handoff requirements:

1. **Start with Phase 1** - Build the API foundation first
2. **Use this simplified schema** - No complex migrations needed
3. **Focus on the happy path** - Error handling can be basic initially
4. **Test with real PDFs early** - Validate Docling/OpenAI integration quickly
5. **Deploy frequently** - Use CDK for infrastructure automation

The architecture supports all PRD requirements while eliminating over-engineering. Build this first, learn from real usage, then iterate based on customer feedback.

**Critical Success Factors:**
- Keep database schema simple
- Use Step Functions for reliability
- Focus on API contract consistency
- Monitor token usage for cost control

This MVP can be built in 4-6 weeks and will provide immediate value to customers while establishing a foundation for future enhancements.
