# Detailed assessment findings
assessment:
  requirements_coverage: "100% - All 6 acceptance criteria fully satisfied"
  test_coverage: "Comprehensive - Unit tests for handlers, database, and integration scenarios"
  code_quality: "High - Clean architecture, proper error handling, good separation of concerns"
  security_compliance: "Strong - Input validation, size limits, UTF-8 safety, no sensitive logging"
  performance_characteristics: "Good - Efficient storage, retrieval caps, proper indexing"

# Test architecture analysis
test_analysis:
  unit_tests:
    - "ocr-processing.test.ts: 6 test scenarios covering validation, size limits, error handling"
    - "job-management.ocr.test.ts: 4 test scenarios for retrieval endpoint with truncation"
    - "database unit tests: Repository upsert and mapping validation"
  integration_tests:
    - "End-to-end OCR workflow tested locally with live AWS infrastructure"
    - "Step Functions workflow integration verified"
  coverage_assessment: "All critical paths covered with appropriate test levels"

# Architecture review
architecture_review:
  design_patterns: "Repository pattern, clean separation between handler/service/data layers"
  error_handling: "Comprehensive error mapping and graceful degradation"
  data_integrity: "Proper upsert semantics with COALESCE for idempotency"
  scalability: "TOAST compression for large text, configurable size limits"
  observability: "Structured logging without sensitive data exposure"

# Compliance verification
compliance_check:
  acceptance_criteria:
    ac1_storage: "✓ Raw OCR text stored in job_results.raw_ocr_text"
    ac2_metadata: "✓ Provider, duration_ms, pages metadata persisted"
    ac3_status_phase: "✓ Status 'processing' and phase 'analyzing_invoice' managed by workflow"
    ac4_size_limits: "✓ 1MB pre-storage limit enforced with configurable OCR_TEXT_MAX_BYTES"
    ac5_validation: "✓ Non-empty, UTF-8 safe, reasonable length validation implemented"
    ac6_retrieval: "✓ GET /jobs/{jobId}/ocr with 256KB default cap, ?raw=true for full text"

# Technical debt assessment
technical_debt:
  current: "Minimal - Well-architected implementation following established patterns"
  future_considerations:
    - "Large text storage optimization (noted in story for future S3 externalization)"
    - "CloudWatch custom metrics (explicitly deferred from MVP scope)"
  maintenance_burden: "Low - Clear interfaces, comprehensive tests, good documentation"
