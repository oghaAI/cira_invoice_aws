# Project Brief: CIRA Invoice Processing System

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-09-10  
**Status:** Draft for Review

## Executive Summary

CIRA is an AI-powered invoice processing system that transforms PDF invoices from URLs into structured, verified data through intelligent OCR and dual-LLM validation. The system addresses the critical business need for automated invoice processing at scale, targeting organizations that handle 20+ invoices daily and need reliable, accurate data extraction without manual intervention.

**Key Value Propositions:**
- **Accuracy First:** Dual-LLM verification ensures high-quality data extraction
- **Scalable Architecture:** Queue-based processing handles varying workloads efficiently  
- **Flexible Schema:** Configurable extraction patterns adapt to different invoice formats
- **Cost Transparent:** Built-in tracking provides visibility into processing costs per job

## Problem Statement

Organizations processing invoices manually face significant operational challenges:

**Current State Pain Points:**
- **Manual Processing Bottlenecks:** Teams spend 15-30 minutes per invoice on data entry and verification
- **Error-Prone Workflows:** Human data entry introduces 2-5% error rates in financial data
- **Scaling Limitations:** Adding processing capacity requires linear increases in staff
- **Inconsistent Quality:** Different operators extract different data points with varying accuracy

**Impact Quantification:**
- Organizations processing 100+ invoices/month spend 25-50 hours on manual data entry
- Error correction and reconciliation adds another 10-20% time overhead
- Staff costs for invoice processing range from $3-8 per invoice depending on complexity

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:**
- Generic OCR tools lack invoice-specific intelligence and validation
- Enterprise solutions require complex integration and high upfront costs
- Simple automation tools can't handle invoice format variability
- Most solutions don't provide cost transparency or processing traceability

**Urgency:** With remote work increasing digital document processing needs, organizations need reliable automation that works with existing PDF-based workflows without requiring format standardization from vendors.

## Proposed Solution

CIRA provides intelligent, automated invoice processing through a queue-based architecture that combines advanced OCR with dual-LLM validation:

**Core Concept:**
- **Single API Endpoint:** Accepts PDF URLs and returns structured data with job tracking
- **Intelligent Processing:** Docling OCR → LLM validation → Mistral OCR fallback → Final LLM verification
- **Flexible Output:** Configurable extraction schemas adapt to different business needs
- **Cost Transparency:** Per-job cost tracking enables accurate billing and ROI measurement

**Key Differentiators:**
1. **Dual-LLM Verification:** Two-stage validation ensures 95%+ accuracy vs single-pass solutions
2. **URL-Based Processing:** No file upload complexity, works with existing document management systems
3. **Queue Architecture:** Handles traffic spikes and provides natural scalability patterns
4. **Schema Flexibility:** Clients can customize extraction fields without system redesign

**Why This Will Succeed:**
- **Focused Scope:** URL-only input reduces complexity while serving majority of use cases
- **Proven Technology Stack:** Built on established AWS services (Step Functions, RDS, API Gateway)
- **Cost-Aware Design:** Built-in cost tracking enables sustainable pricing and optimization
- **Incremental Adoption:** Works alongside existing workflows without requiring system overhauls

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints
- **Budget:** $10,000 development budget for MVP, $2,000/month operational costs for first 6 months
- **Timeline:** MVP delivery within 8 weeks, beta launch by week 12, general availability by week 16
- **Resources:** 2 full-stack developers, 1 part-time DevOps engineer, 1 business analyst for requirements
- **Technical:** AWS ecosystem lock-in acceptable, English-only invoice processing initially, PDF format only for MVP

### Key Assumptions
- Docling OCR service will maintain acceptable availability and processing quality for production use
- Target customers are willing to adapt workflows to URL-based invoice submission vs file upload
- OpenAI/Azure pricing remains stable enough to maintain target cost per invoice processing
- Market demand exists for API-first invoice processing vs UI-heavy solutions
- Customers will accept polling-based job status vs real-time notifications for MVP
- PostgreSQL can handle projected transaction volume without significant performance optimization

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks
- **OCR Service Dependency:** Heavy reliance on external OCR services creates availability and cost risks - *Impact: System unavailable if primary OCR fails*
- **LLM Cost Escalation:** OpenAI pricing changes could make processing uneconomical - *Impact: Need to increase customer pricing or reduce profitability*
- **Invoice Format Variability:** PDF invoices may have formats that resist reliable OCR processing - *Impact: Lower success rates reduce customer satisfaction*
- **Competition Response:** Established players (DocuWare, ABBYY) may launch similar solutions quickly - *Impact: Reduced market opportunity and pricing pressure*
- **Customer Adoption Speed:** API-first approach may slow adoption vs UI-friendly alternatives - *Impact: Extended timeline to revenue targets*

### Open Questions
- What specific invoice fields should the default extraction schema include beyond basic vendor/amount/date?
- How will customers be notified when jobs require manual review due to verification failures?
- What retry and backoff strategies should be implemented for external service failures?
- How detailed should cost tracking be - per API call, per job, or aggregated monthly reporting?
- What data retention policies are needed for compliance with financial regulations?

### Areas Needing Further Research
- **Competitive Analysis:** Deep dive into existing invoice processing solutions and pricing models
- **Customer Development:** Interviews with target segment to validate assumptions about workflow preferences
- **Technical Validation:** OCR service testing with diverse invoice samples to validate processing assumptions
- **Pricing Strategy:** Market research on willingness to pay for different service tiers and usage models
- **Compliance Requirements:** Research financial data handling regulations for target geographic markets
