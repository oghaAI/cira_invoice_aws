# CIRA Invoice Processing System Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2025-09-10  
**Status:** Draft for Review

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Achieve 95%+ accuracy in invoice data extraction through dual-LLM verification system
- Reduce invoice processing time from 15-30 minutes to under 2 minutes per invoice  
- Enable scalable processing of 10,000+ invoices/month through queue-based architecture
- Provide cost-transparent processing with detailed per-job cost attribution
- Deliver API-first solution that integrates seamlessly with existing document workflows
- Establish foundation for $50K ARR within 12 months through mid-market customer acquisition

### Background Context
CIRA addresses the critical operational bottleneck faced by mid-market organizations processing 50-500 invoices monthly. Current manual workflows consume 15-30 minutes per invoice with 2-5% error rates, creating scaling limitations that require linear staff increases. Existing solutions either lack invoice-specific intelligence (generic OCR) or require complex enterprise integrations with high upfront costs.

The system leverages URL-based PDF processing through a queue architecture, combining Docling OCR with dual-LLM validation to achieve enterprise-grade accuracy while maintaining API simplicity. Built on AWS infrastructure with Step Functions orchestration, CIRA provides the missing link between document management systems and accounting software, enabling organizations to handle 3x invoice volume without additional staff.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
API-first experience with clean, minimal dashboard for job monitoring and cost tracking. The interface should feel like a developer tool - fast, informative, and data-dense without unnecessary visual complexity. Primary focus on operational visibility rather than consumer-friendly design.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Job-Centric Navigation:** All interactions revolve around job submission, monitoring, and results retrieval
- **Polling-Based Updates:** Real-time status updates through automatic refresh rather than push notifications
- **Data Export Focus:** Easy CSV/JSON export of processing results and cost reports for integration with accounting workflows
- **API Documentation Integrated:** In-app API explorer and documentation for developer self-service

### Core Screens and Views
- **Job Dashboard:** Real-time view of active jobs with status, timing, and cost information
- **Job Detail Page:** Individual job results with extracted data, confidence scores, and processing timeline
- **API Keys Management:** Generate, revoke, and monitor API key usage and permissions
- **Cost Analytics:** Monthly processing costs, usage trends, and per-job cost breakdown
- **Account Settings:** Basic account management and notification preferences

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
Standard web accessibility compliance for business tool usage - keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, sufficient color contrast for data visualization.

### Branding
Clean, professional developer tool aesthetic. Minimal branding to maintain focus on functionality. Consistent with modern API service interfaces (similar to Stripe Dashboard or AWS Console styling).

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Desktop-first responsive design optimized for business users on laptops/desktops, with mobile-friendly responsive breakpoints for job monitoring on mobile devices.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Single repository with separate packages for API services, database schemas, and shared utilities. Supports unified dependency management and simplified deployment coordination across microservices.

### Service Architecture
**Microservices with Step Functions Orchestration:** API Gateway routes requests to individual Lambda functions, with AWS Step Functions managing the processing workflow (queue → OCR → extraction → verification). This provides scalability and fault isolation while maintaining orchestration visibility.

### Testing Requirements
**Unit + Integration + E2E Testing:** Comprehensive testing pyramid including unit tests for business logic, integration tests for external service interactions (Docling, OpenAI), and end-to-end API testing for complete workflows. Manual testing convenience methods needed for invoice processing validation.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Core Technology Stack:**
- **Backend Framework:** Node.js with Express for Lambda functions, TypeScript for type safety
- **Database:** PostgreSQL on AWS RDS with connection pooling, Redis for caching job status
- **Infrastructure:** AWS ecosystem (API Gateway, Step Functions, Lambda, RDS, CloudWatch)
- **Container Strategy:** Docker for local development, serverless deployment for production

**External Service Integration:**
- **Primary OCR:** Docling OCR service with 5-minute timeout and exponential backoff retry
- **LLM Processing:** Azure OpenAI GPT-4 with structured output mode for data extraction
- **Future OCR Fallback:** Mistral OCR integration planned for Phase 2 dual-validation

**Data Management:**
- **Job Identifiers:** NanoID for shorter, URL-safe job IDs vs UUID
- **Data Retention:** 90-day retention policy for job data and results
- **Cost Tracking:** Per-job cost attribution including all external API usage
- **Encryption:** AES-256 encryption at rest, TLS 1.3 for data in transit

**Development & Deployment:**
- **Version Control:** Git with conventional commits for automated changelog generation  
- **CI/CD Pipeline:** GitHub Actions with automated testing and AWS deployment
- **Monitoring:** AWS CloudWatch for metrics, structured JSON logging for debugging
- **Environment Management:** Development, staging, and production environments with infrastructure as code

**Performance & Scalability:**
- **Concurrent Processing:** Support for 20-25 concurrent jobs with auto-scaling Lambda functions
- **Database Optimization:** Connection pooling and read replicas for query scaling
- **Caching Strategy:** Redis for job status caching to reduce database load
- **Rate Limiting:** API Gateway rate limiting to prevent service abuse
