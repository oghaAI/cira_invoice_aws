# Story 2.1: Step Functions Workflow

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
As a processing orchestrator,
I want a simple 3-state Step Functions workflow,
so that jobs progress through OCR and completion reliably.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Create Step Functions state machine with states: StartOCR → ExtractData → Complete
2. Wire each state to an existing Lambda: OCR → LLM extraction → Job completion
3. Implement retry policy on each Lambda state: 3 attempts, exponential backoff (2s base, max 30s)
4. Enable CloudWatch execution logs with full event data and 30-day retention
5. Deploy the state machine via CDK and output its ARN and name
6. Update job status during processing: set to "processing" at start; set to "completed" or "failed" at end; persist timestamps
7. Track processing phase while `status=processing` using `processing_phase` with values: `analyzing_invoice`, `extracting_data`, `verifying_data`
8. Expose optional `phase` and `phase_label` in GET `/jobs/{id}/status` when `status=processing`
9. Allow POST /jobs to trigger the state machine after job creation, passing `jobId` and `pdfUrl`
10. Add IAM permissions for API Lambda to `StartExecution` on the state machine

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Define 3-state workflow in CDK (AC: 1, 2, 5)
  - [x] Ensure states sequence: `OcrProcessingStep` → `LlmExtractionStep` → `JobCompletionStep`
  - [x] Use `aws-stepfunctions-tasks.LambdaInvoke` for each task
  - [x] Set `outputPath: '$.Payload'` to pass through handler outputs between steps

- [x] Task 2: Add retry and error handling (AC: 3)
  - [x] Configure `addRetry` on each LambdaInvoke with `{ maxAttempts: 3, backoffRate: 2.0, interval: 2s, maxDelay: 30s }`
  - [x] Ensure `addCatch` transitions to explicit Fail states per step
  - [x] Include error details in CloudWatch logs

- [x] Task 3: Execution logging (AC: 4)
  - [x] Create dedicated log group `/aws/stepfunctions/${env}-invoice-processing`
  - [x] Set retention to 30 days (ONE_MONTH)
  - [x] Enable `includeExecutionData: true` and `LogLevel.ALL`

- [x] Task 4: Job status + phase updates (AC: 6, 7, 8)
  - [x] At workflow start: set job status to `processing` and update `updated_at`
  - [x] Set `processing_phase` at step begins: `analyzing_invoice` (OCR), `extracting_data` (LLM), `verifying_data` (completion checks)
  - [x] Expose `phase` + `phase_label` in status response when `status=processing`
  - [x] On success: set status `completed`, clear `processing_phase`, set `completed_at`, update `updated_at`
  - [x] On failure: set status `failed`, clear `processing_phase`, persist `error_message`, update `updated_at`
  - [x] Use existing Job Management Lambda action payload `{ action: 'complete' | 'fail', jobId, result?, error? }`

- [x] Task 5: API integration to trigger workflow (AC: 9, 10)
  - [x] After creating a job in POST `/jobs`, call Step Functions `StartExecution`
  - [x] Input payload: `{ jobId, pdfUrl }`
  - [x] Add IAM permission for API Lambda to `states:StartExecution` on this state machine
  - [x] Log execution ARN and jobId for traceability

- [x] Task 6: CDK outputs and wiring (AC: 5, 8)
  - [x] Output State Machine ARN and Name
  - [x] Expose ARN to API stack as an environment variable for the API Lambda
  - [x] Grant API Lambda permission to start the state machine

- [ ] Task 7: Tests (See Testing)
  - [ ] Unit test: POST `/jobs` triggers `StartExecution` with correct input
  - [ ] Snapshot/structural test: state machine has 3 steps and retries configured
  - [ ] Unit test: job completion updates persisted fields

## Dev Notes

### Current Code References
- Workflow stack scaffold already exists: `packages/infrastructure/src/stacks/workflow-stack.ts`
- API stack defines Lambdas used for steps:
  - OCR: `packages/api/src/handlers/ocr-processing.ts`
  - LLM: `packages/api/src/handlers/llm-extraction.ts`
  - Job completion / management: `packages/api/src/handlers/job-management.ts`
- API stack file: `packages/infrastructure/src/stacks/api-stack.ts`
- Monitoring stack references Step Functions metrics: `packages/infrastructure/src/stacks/monitoring-stack.ts`

### Implementation Guidance
- Workflow definition
  - Ensure the state machine definition uses the three LambdaInvoke tasks in order.
  - Add `addRetry({ maxAttempts: 3, backoffRate: 2.0, interval: 2s, maxDelay: 30s })` on each task.
  - Keep existing `addCatch` → Fail states for explicit failure paths.
- Logging
  - Use a dedicated log group with 30-day retention and `includeExecutionData: true`.
  - Confirm log group removal policy aligns with non-prod vs prod.
- Job status updates
  - At start, either: (a) call a small "status" Lambda to set `processing`, or (b) extend `job-management` handler to handle `{ action: 'start' }` if preferred. For MVP, option (b) using existing handler is acceptable.
  - For completion, the existing completion step payload can include `{ action: 'complete', jobId, result, metadata }`.
  - For failure paths, add a separate LambdaInvoke or reuse job-management with `{ action: 'fail', jobId, error }`.
  - Phase mapping: OCR → `analyzing_invoice`; LLM → `extracting_data`; completion checks → `verifying_data`.
  - DB: `jobs.processing_phase TEXT CHECK (processing_phase IN ('analyzing_invoice','extracting_data','verifying_data'))`.
  - API: Include `phase` and user-friendly `phase_label` in status response only when `status=processing`.
- API trigger
  - In `job-management.ts` POST `/jobs`, after DB insert, call Step Functions `StartExecution` with `{ jobId, pdfUrl }`.
  - Inject the state machine ARN via env var from the Workflow stack.
  - Grant IAM permission to API Lambda for `states:StartExecution` on that ARN.

### CDK Wiring
- Pass `apiStack` into `WorkflowStack` (already present) and grant invokes for the three Lambdas.
- Export state machine ARN via `CfnOutput` and also pass it to `ApiStack` environment.
- In `ApiStack`, add permission for the API Lambda to start executions of the state machine (policy statement on the Lambda role).

## Testing

### Unit / Structural Tests
- Given a new job is created via POST `/jobs`
  - When the handler completes
  - Then `states:StartExecution` is invoked once with input `{ jobId, pdfUrl }` and correct state machine ARN

- Given the workflow definition is synthesized
  - When inspecting the state machine definition
  - Then it contains 3 LambdaInvoke states in order with retries configured `maxAttempts=3`, exponential backoff

- Given a successful workflow run
  - When the completion step executes
  - Then the job status updates to `completed`, `processing_phase` cleared, `completed_at` is set, and `updated_at` changes

- Given a failure in OCR or LLM step
  - When retries are exhausted
  - Then the failure path sets job status to `failed`, clears `processing_phase`, persists error message, and updates `updated_at`

### API Status Shape (processing)
- Example:
  `{
    "id": "uuid",
    "status": "processing",
    "phase": "analyzing_invoice" | "extracting_data" | "verifying_data",
    "phase_label": "Analyzing invoice" | "Extracting data" | "Verifying data",
    "created_at": "...",
    "updated_at": "..."
  }`

### Observability
- CloudWatch logs for Step Functions include execution input/output and errors
- Alarms for failed executions can be added/verified in `monitoring-stack` (optional in this story if already present)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-13

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Well-structured Step Functions workflow with proper state sequencing (StartProcessing → SetPhase → ProcessingStep pattern)
- Comprehensive error handling with explicit failure paths and proper catch/retry configuration
- Good separation of concerns between infrastructure (CDK) and business logic (Lambda handlers)
- CloudWatch logging properly configured with full execution data and 30-day retention
- Database schema matches requirements with proper constraints for processing phases
- IAM permissions correctly granted for cross-service communication

**Implementation Quality:** Overall solid implementation with enterprise-grade error handling and observability patterns.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was performed during this review as the code quality meets standards.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards:** ✓ TypeScript conventions followed, proper error handling patterns
- **Project Structure:** ✓ Correct package organization and CDK stack separation
- **Testing Strategy:** ✗ **CRITICAL GAP** - Task 7 incomplete, no tests implemented
- **All ACs Met:** ✓ All 10 acceptance criteria functionally implemented

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] **BLOCKING:** Implement missing Task 7 tests before production deployment
  - [ ] Unit test: POST `/jobs` triggers `StartExecution` with correct input
  - [ ] Structural test: State machine has 3 steps and retries configured
  - [ ] Unit test: Job completion updates persist correct fields
- [ ] Consider adding CDK unit tests for infrastructure validation
- [ ] Add integration test for complete workflow (OCR → LLM → Complete)
- [ ] Consider adding performance tests for Step Functions execution time limits
- [ ] Add monitoring alerts for Step Functions failed executions (mentioned as optional)

### Security Review

**Status:** PASS with recommendations

- **IAM Permissions:** ✓ Proper least-privilege access controls implemented
- **Data Protection:** ✓ Database credentials properly managed via Secrets Manager
- **Error Handling:** ✓ No sensitive data leaked in error messages or logs
- **Network Security:** ✓ VPC and RDS configuration follows security best practices

**Recommendations:**
- Consider adding input validation in Step Functions for jobId/pdfUrl parameters
- Add CloudTrail logging for Step Functions StartExecution API calls for audit trails

### Performance Considerations

**Status:** PASS with observations

- **Step Functions:** ✓ 30-minute timeout appropriate for processing workflow
- **Lambda Timeouts:** ✓ Reasonable timeouts (1-15min) based on processing complexity
- **Retry Policy:** ✓ Exponential backoff with circuit breaker prevents resource exhaustion
- **Database:** ✓ Indexed queries and connection pooling implemented

**Observations:**
- OCR/LLM handlers currently simulate processing (placeholders) - actual performance will depend on real implementation
- Database connection pooling (max: 10) appropriate for expected load

### Files Modified During Review

No files were modified during this review.

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/2.1-step-functions-workflow.yml

### Recommended Status

**✗ Changes Required - Critical testing gap must be addressed**

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. Complete Task 7: Implement all three required unit tests
2. Run test suite and verify all tests pass
3. Update File List to include test files

**Advisory Actions:**
1. Consider integration tests for complete workflow validation
2. Add CDK infrastructure tests for deployment validation
3. Implement monitoring alerts for failed executions

The implementation quality is excellent and all functional requirements are met, but the absence of tests creates a critical deployment risk that must be addressed before moving to Done status.
