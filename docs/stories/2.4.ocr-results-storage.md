# Story 2.4: OCR Results Storage

## Status
Completed

## Story
As a data manager,
I want OCR text stored properly,
so that extracted text is available for LLM processing.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Store raw OCR text in `job_results` for the associated `job_id`.
2. Persist extraction metadata (at minimum: `pages` if available, and `ocr_duration_ms`).
3. Ensure job status reflects progress during OCR (status `processing`) and phase is set appropriately (e.g., `analyzing_invoice`).
4. Enforce a pre-storage size limit for OCR text (e.g., 1 MB) and reject over-limit payloads.
5. Implement basic text validation (non-empty, UTF-8 safe, reasonable length bounds).
6. Provide a retrieval path for debugging that returns stored OCR text and metadata while truncating the text to a safe size by default (e.g., first 256 KB).

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Database schema support (AC: 1, 2, 4)
  - [x] Add `raw_ocr_text TEXT` column to `job_results` (nullable) for storing Markdown output from OCR.
  - [x] Add `ocr_provider VARCHAR(64)`, `ocr_duration_ms INTEGER`, and `ocr_pages INTEGER` columns to `job_results` (nullable) for metadata.
  - [x] Do not compute or persist confidence; treat any existing confidence column as optional/unused for OCR.
  - [x] Migration: update `packages/database/schema.sql` and align TS types in `packages/database/src/models/jobResult.ts` and `packages/database/src/index.ts`.

- [x] Task 2: Repository and API updates (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Extend `IDatabaseClient.upsertJobResult(...)` to accept `rawOcrText`, `ocrProvider`, `ocrDurationMs`, `ocrPages`.
  - [x] Update SQL upsert in `packages/database/src/index.ts` to write new columns when provided and preserve existing values via `COALESCE`.
  - [x] Update `JobResult` interface mapping to include new fields.

- [x] Task 3: OCR handler persistence (AC: 1, 2, 3, 5)
  - [x] In `packages/api/src/handlers/ocr-processing.ts`, after successful OCR, persist:
        `{ jobId, rawOcrText, ocrProvider, ocrDurationMs, ocrPages }` via database client.
  - [x] Ensure status/phase are set via workflow (Story 2.1) to `processing` and `analyzing_invoice`.
  - [x] Validate text: non-empty, UTF-8 safe, below configured max size; reject oversized payloads.

- [x] Task 4: Size limits and retrieval caps (AC: 4, 6)
  - [x] Enforce a 1 MB max size for `raw_ocr_text` prior to persistence (`OCR_TEXT_MAX_BYTES`, default 1,048,576 bytes).
  - [x] Retrieval returns at most the first 256 KB by default; `?raw=true` returns full text (`OCR_RETRIEVAL_MAX_BYTES`, default 262,144 bytes).
  - [x] Document thresholds in code; both caps configurable via env vars.

- [x] Task 5: Retrieval for debugging (AC: 6)
  - [x] Add `GET /jobs/{jobId}/ocr` to return `{ provider, pages?, duration_ms, raw_ocr_text, truncated }` with client isolation.
  - [x] Redact/limit payload size by default; allow `?raw=true` for full text.

- [x] Task 6: Observability & logging (AC: 2, 5)
  - [x] Log OCR decision with `jobId`, `bytes`, `provider`, `ocrDurationMs` without logging text.
  - [ ] (Optional) CloudWatch custom metrics – deferred from MVP.

- [x] Task 7: Tests (Unit + Integration) (AC: 1–6)
  - [x] Unit: repository upsert writes new columns and maps correctly.
  - [x] Unit: OCR handler persists `raw_ocr_text` and metadata; validates empty/oversize; DB calls mocked.
  - [x] Unit: retrieval endpoint truncates by default and can return full text with `?raw=true`.
  - [x] Integration: exercised locally; live infra tests out of scope for this story.

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree
- OCR handler: `packages/api/src/handlers/ocr-processing.ts`
- Job management/API: `packages/api/src/handlers/job-management.ts`
- Database client/interfaces: `packages/database/src/index.ts`
- Database model: `packages/database/src/models/jobResult.ts`
- SQL schema & migrations: `packages/database/schema.sql`
- Step Functions workflow: `packages/infrastructure/src/stacks/workflow-stack.ts`

### Architecture & Constraints
- Storage model: The architecture defines a `JobResult` for invoice extraction and OCR text storage. Current MVP schema includes `job_results (extracted_data JSONB, confidence_score, tokens_used)`. This story adds explicit storage for raw OCR Markdown and OCR metadata.
- Security & privacy: Do not log raw OCR text or full URLs. Only log lengths, durations, and decision codes.
- Network & subnets: OCR worker runs with egress enabled; DB access via RDS Proxy env vars (`DATABASE_PROXY_ENDPOINT`, `DATABASE_NAME`).
- Workflow: Step Functions sets status/phase during processing (Story 2.1). Ensure phase reflects OCR step (`analyzing_invoice`).

### Future Consideration: Compression/Externalization
- Postgres will automatically TOAST-compress large TEXT/JSONB; application-layer gzip is unnecessary for MVP and adds complexity.
- If average OCR payloads grow (>1–2 MB) or storage costs rise, consider storing full OCR text in S3 and keeping only a pointer in `job_results`, with on-demand retrieval.

### Implementation Guidance
- Upsert strategy: Keep upsert idempotent by `job_id` unique key. New columns should update on conflict.
- Backwards compatibility: Keep existing `extracted_data`, `tokens_used` semantics for LLM step; confidence is not used for OCR and may remain null if present in schema.
- Retrieval endpoint: Respect client isolation using existing clientId checks in job routes; cap payload size and allow optional `?raw=true` to return full text when safe.

### Testing
- Unit tests live beside source files using Vitest (see patterns in `packages/api/src/handlers/*.test.ts`).
- Use mocks for DB to assert SQL parameterization and mapping.
- Avoid network calls; focus on handler → repository interactions and content limits.

## Change Log
- 2025-09-13: Initial draft created for Story 2.4 — outlines DB schema updates, handler persistence, compression, retrieval endpoint, and tests.
- 2025-09-13: Updated to remove confidence scoring/requirements per product decision; treat any existing confidence fields as optional/unused for OCR.
- 2025-09-14: Implemented schema columns, repository methods, OCR persistence with validation and size caps, retrieval endpoint with truncation, and tests. Trimmed Step Functions payload to avoid state size limits. Added Step Functions choice for OCR error objects.

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
GPT-4 (Codex CLI) – local unit tests (Vitest) + manual AWS verification

### Debug Log References
CloudWatch Logs
- /aws/lambda/CiraInvoice-Api-dev-OcrProcessingFunction…
  - decision: "OK", jobId, bytes, provider, ocrDurationMs
- /aws/lambda/CiraInvoice-Api-dev-JobManagementFunction…
  - "Incoming request" POST /jobs, "Triggered Step Functions execution", retrieval GET /jobs/{jobId}/ocr

Step Functions
- OCR result routed via Choice; success path: SetPhaseExtracting → LlmExtraction → SetPhaseVerifying → JobCompletion → Success
- Error path: JobFailFromOcrStep → OcrFailed

### Completion Notes List
- Persisted raw OCR markdown to job_results.raw_ocr_text with provider, duration_ms, pages; validated UTF‑8 and size (1 MB cap).
- Added retrieval endpoint GET /jobs/{jobId}/ocr with 256 KB default truncation and ?raw=true for full text.
- Trimmed OCR Lambda response to Step Functions to avoid 256 KB state limit; store only metadata in state.
- Sanitized numeric fields to avoid NaN inserts (ocr_duration_ms, ocr_pages).
- Wired workflow to handle provider error objects cleanly via Choice.
- Verified end-to-end on AWS: OCR persisted and retrievable; sample response shows provider=mistral, pages=4, truncated=false.

### Risk Assessment Summary

**Risk Level**: LOW with 2 medium-priority monitoring areas

**Medium Risks Identified**:
1. **Database Storage Growth**: Large OCR text volumes could impact storage costs and query performance over time
   - **Mitigation**: Size limits enforced, PostgreSQL TOAST compression active, S3 externalization noted for future
2. **Step Functions State Limits**: Large metadata payloads could approach 256KB state size limits
   - **Mitigation**: OCR response payload trimmed to essential metadata only

**Risk Mitigation Quality**: ✅ Excellent - All identified risks have implemented controls or documented future strategies

### Gate Status

**Gate**: PASS → docs/qa/gates/2.4-ocr-results-storage.yml
