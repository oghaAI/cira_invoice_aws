# Story 2.3: Provider-Agnostic PDF→Markdown OCR

## Status
Done

## Story
As a text extractor,
I want a provider-agnostic OCR adapter that converts PDFs to Markdown,
so that PDF invoices are converted to Markdown regardless of OCR provider.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Define a generic OCR provider interface (single entrypoint) that accepts a PDF by URL/stream and returns Markdown plus basic metadata (e.g., confidence, pages, processing time).
2. Implement at least one concrete adapter behind the interface — start with Mistral OCR — selected via configuration (e.g., environment variable) without changing call sites.
3. Ensure output is Markdown with reasonable structure preservation (headings, lists, tables when possible) and UTF-8 safe text.
4. Support both synchronous and asynchronous provider flows with polling and a 5-minute timeout; include exponential backoff retries on transient errors.
5. Map provider-specific errors to unified error categories (validation, auth, quota, timeout, server) and propagate meaningful messages.
6. Emit structured logs for all provider interactions (provider name, request id, duration, bytes/pages processed) without leaking sensitive data.
7. Return Markdown and metadata to the next pipeline step for storage (actual DB persistence is covered in Story 2.4).

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: OCR Provider Interface (AC: 1)
  - [x] Create `packages/api/src/services/ocr/index.ts` with `OcrProvider` interface
  - [x] Define `extract({ pdfUrl | stream }): Promise<{ markdown: string; metadata: { confidence?: number; pages?: number; durationMs: number; provider: string } }>`
  - [x] Add unified error types and categories

- [x] Task 2: Concrete Adapter: Mistral OCR (AC: 2, 4, 5, 6)
  - [x] Implement `mistral` adapter with environment-driven config
  - [x] Env vars: `MISTRAL_OCR_API_URL`, `MISTRAL_API_KEY`; validate presence
  - [x] Support URL submission first (prefer passing `pdfUrl`), fall back to streaming upload if API requires (scaffolded)
  - [x] Add polling for async flows with 5-minute timeout and exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s; cap 8s; max attempts 5) with jitter
  - [x] Map provider responses/errors to unified categories and typed errors
  - [x] Log provider name, request id, duration, pages processed (no content)

- [x] Task 3: Handler Integration (AC: 3, 7)
  - [x] Update `packages/api/src/handlers/ocr-processing.ts` to use `OcrProvider` via a factory by `process.env.OCR_PROVIDER`
  - [x] Validate payload `{ jobId, pdfUrl }` (already done from Story 2.2) then call `provider.extract`
  - [x] On success: return `{ jobId, ocr: { provider, markdown, metadata } }` for the next pipeline step (storage in 2.4)
  - [x] On failure: map to structured error consumed by Step Functions catch to mark `OcrFailed`

- [x] Task 4: Configuration (AC: 2)
  - [x] Add `OCR_PROVIDER=mistral` env var to OCR Lambda in `api-stack.ts`
  - [x] Add provider-specific envs: `MISTRAL_OCR_API_URL`, `MISTRAL_API_KEY`

- [x] Task 5: Logging & Error Mapping (AC: 5, 6)
  - [x] Emit structured logs without content leakage; include `provider`, `requestId`, `durationMs`, `pages`
  - [x] Map to unified error categories: `VALIDATION`, `AUTH`, `QUOTA`, `TIMEOUT`, `SERVER`, `FAILED_STATUS`

- [x] Task 6: Output Contract (AC: 7)
  - [x] Ensure handler returns `{ ocr: { provider, markdown, metadata } }` without DB writes (storage deferred to Story 2.4)
  - [x] Confirm LLM step consumes Markdown as input in later stories

- [x] Task 7: Step Functions Compatibility (AC: 4, 7)
  - [x] Ensure retries and timeouts align with Step Functions retry policies (Story 2.1)
  - [x] Maintain small payload size; avoid returning full binary content

- [x] Task 8: CDK/Config Validation (AC: 2)
  - [x] Ensure OCR Lambda remains `PRIVATE_WITH_EGRESS` for external HTTP calls
  - [x] Wire environment variables for provider selection and credentials if needed

- [x] Task 9: Tests (See Testing)
  - [x] Unit: mock adapter returns Markdown + metadata; handler passes through
  - [x] Unit: retries/backoff and timeout behavior for async provider
  - [x] Unit: error mapping to unified categories; no retry on AUTH/VALIDATION
  - [x] Unit: logging fields present; no content leakage

## Dev Notes

### Integration Boundaries
- Run OCR adapter inside `ocr-processing` Lambda after URL validation (Story 2.2).
- The Step Function already sets phase/status updates (Story 2.1). Reuse those; do not duplicate status logic.
- Keep responses minimal; pass Markdown and metadata to next step; DB storage is Story 2.4.

- ### Environment & Security
- Env vars: `OCR_PROVIDER=mistral` and provider-specific creds (namespaced). Do not hardcode.
- Do not log full PDF URLs or OCR text; only lengths and timing.
- Keep outbound calls over HTTPS only.

### Output Contract (for Story 2.4 storage)
```json
{
  "ocr": {
    "provider": "mistral",
    "markdown": "# Invoice\n...",
    "metadata": {
      "confidence": 0.92,
      "pages": 2,
      "durationMs": 1234
    }
  }
}
```

### Error Mapping
- AUTH (401/403), VALIDATION (400) → no retry
- QUOTA (429) → limited retries with backoff
- TIMEOUT / SERVER (5xx, network) → retry until cap then surface error
- FAILED_STATUS (provider returns failed) → surface provider reason

### Observability
- Log: `{ decision, jobId, requestId, hostname, durationMs, attempt }`
- Consider adding simple counters/metrics later (Monitoring stack) – not required in this story

## Testing

### Unit Tests (handler + adapter)
- Adapter returns Markdown with metadata; handler passes through and preserves contract
- Retries/backoff for transient errors; respects max attempts and timeout
- No retry on AUTH/VALIDATION; error mapping preserved
- No content leakage in logs; essential fields present

### Integration Tests (or high-level unit with mocks)
- `ocr-processing` handler validates URL then invokes Docling client and returns minimal structure for LLM step
- Failure path throws structured errors caught by Step Functions and updates status accordingly

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-13

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Quality: Excellent** - The implementation demonstrates strong adherence to SOLID principles, comprehensive error handling, and well-structured abstraction layers. The provider-agnostic interface cleanly separates concerns, and the Mistral adapter implements robust async polling with proper backoff strategies. Code is production-ready with good security practices.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: packages/api/src/services/ocr/mistral.test.ts
  - **Change**: Added comprehensive logging validation test case
  - **Why**: Story AC6 required validation that logs contain essential fields without content leakage
  - **How**: Added test that verifies structured logging includes provider, requestId, durationMs, pages while confirming no sensitive PDF content or URLs are logged

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ TypeScript strict mode, consistent naming, proper error handling
- Project Structure: ✓ Modular service architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit tests with mocking, integration tests available, good coverage
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 7 acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested
