### Coding Standards Requirements
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- **Languages & Runtimes**: Node.js 20.11.0, TypeScript 5.3.3 with strict mode enabled
- **Style & Linting**: ESLint with @typescript-eslint/recommended, Prettier with 2-space indentation
- **Test Organization**: Tests co-located with source code, .test.ts suffix, AAA pattern

### Testing Strategy Requirements
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Framework**: Vitest 2.1.x with TypeScript support and coverage reporting

- Documentation: docs/ directory structure

### Technical Constraints
- Must use npm workspaces for monorepo management
- TypeScript strict mode must be enabled across all packages
- All packages must extend root TypeScript configuration
- GitHub Actions must use OIDC for AWS authentication
- Test coverage must meet minimum thresholds before deployment

### Testing
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Framework**: Vitest 2.1.x with TypeScript support
