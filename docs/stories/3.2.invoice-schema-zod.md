# Story 3.2: Simple Invoice Schema with Zod

## Status
Done

## Story
As a data extractor,
I want basic invoice field extraction defined with Zod,
so that I can return validated structured invoice data.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Adopt the provided modifiable Zod schema shape (all fields optional and nullable as specified):
   - Strings: `invoice_date`, `invoice_number`, `invoice_due_date`, `policy_number`, `account_number`, `policy_start_date`, `policy_end_date`, `service_start_date`, `service_end_date`, `payment_remittance_address`, `payment_remittance_entity`, `payment_remittance_entity_care_of`, `reasoning`, `community_name`, `vendor_name` (all `z.string().nullable().optional()`).
   - Numbers: `invoice_past_due_amount`, `invoice_current_due_amount`, `invoice_late_fee_amount`, `credit_amount` (all `z.number().nullable().optional()`).
   - Boolean: `valid_input: z.boolean().optional()`.
   - Keep field `.describe()` texts to guide the model (synonyms and extraction guidance included).
2. Include a parallel `field_reasoning` map in the schema: `z.record(z.string())` (optional) containing concise reasoning for every field, including when a field is null (e.g., "not present", "ambiguous", "unreadable"); avoid long snippets or PII beyond labels.
3. Include a parallel `field_confidence` map in the schema: `z.record(z.enum(['low','medium','high']))` (optional), with entries for every field. For null fields, confidence typically should be `low` (or `medium` if evidence suggests ambiguity rather than absence).
4. Create TypeScript types with `z.infer<typeof InvoiceSchema>` and export both the schema and type from `packages/api/src/services/llm/schemas/invoice.ts`.
5. Implement structured output using the AI SDK with Zod validation; the model must return only fields in the schema. Unknown keys are ignored.
6. Validate model output against the schema; do not invent values. Strings may be trimmed; numbers may accept numeric-like strings via a safe preprocessor (optional) but must store as numbers or null.
7. Persist extracted data to `job_results.extracted_data` (JSONB), including `field_reasoning` and `field_confidence`. Tolerate missing fields by storing nulls or omitting.
8. The schema must be easily modifiable: adding/removing fields should not break consumers. Provide guidance/comments for evolution.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Implement Provided Schema (AC: 1, 2, 3, 8)
  - [x] Create `packages/api/src/services/llm/schemas/invoice.ts` exporting `InvoiceSchema` exactly matching the provided fields, all `nullable().optional()` as described.
  - [x] Add `field_reasoning?: Record<string,string>` to the schema; keep reasoning concise (≤ 2 sentences), no long snippets.
  - [x] Add `field_confidence?: Record<string, 'low'|'medium'|'high'>` to the schema; include entries for all fields (including nulls) per prompt guidance.
  - [x] Keep `.describe()` texts to guide the LLM (include synonyms and extraction constraints for service dates).
  - [x] Export `export type Invoice = z.infer<typeof InvoiceSchema>`.
  - [x] Add a comment header: "Schema is evolvable; add new optional/nullable fields to avoid breaking changes."

- [x] Task 2: Structured Output with AI SDK (AC: 4, 5, 6)
  - [x] In `packages/api/src/services/llm/client.ts`, add a helper `extractStructured<T>()` that accepts a Zod schema and prompt input, returning `Promise<{ data: T; tokensUsed?: number; confidence?: number }>`
  - [x] Use AI SDK structured output mode with Zod validator; throw `VALIDATION` error on schema failure
  - [x] Include minimal normalization (e.g., trim strings); optional preprocessor can convert numeric-like strings to numbers safely, else null
  - [x] Prompt guidance: "Return only fields in the schema, plus `field_reasoning` (1–2 sentences for every field, including when null) and `field_confidence` (one of: low, medium, high) for every field. For null fields, explain why and set confidence accordingly. Do not return decimals."

- [x] Task 3: Handler Integration (AC: 5, 6, 7)
  - [x] Update `packages/api/src/handlers/llm-extraction.ts` to:
    - [x] Load OCR text from prior step input
    - [x] Call `extractStructured(InvoiceSchema, { markdown })`
    - [x] Receive `{ data, tokensUsed, confidence }`
    - [x] Persist via `DatabaseClient.upsertJobResult({ jobId, extractedData: data, tokensUsed })`
    - [x] Return object for Step Functions: `{ jobId, status: 'llm_completed', extractedData: data, tokensUsed: tokensUsed ?? null }`

- [x] Task 4: Tests (AC: 2, 3, 5, 7)
  - [x] Unit: accepts null/undefined for optional fields; rejects wrong types (e.g., non-numeric strings for numeric fields unless preprocessed)
  - [x] Unit: successful extraction returns typed data matching `Invoice`
  - [x] Unit: handler persists JSONB (including `field_reasoning` and `field_confidence`) and tokens; verify upsert payload
  - [x] Unit: `field_reasoning` provides entries (short strings) explaining both populated and null fields
  - [x] Unit: `field_confidence` contains only low/medium/high; includes entries for null fields (typically `low`)
  - [x] Unit: unknown keys from the model are ignored/stripped

## Dev Notes
- Keep all fields optional+nullable to reflect real-world variance; the orchestrator must not fail just because a field is absent.
- Confidence is intentionally out-of-scope for this story; can be added later as categorical (L/M/H) and mapped server-side.
- Dates: accept strings; avoid silent reformatting. If normalizing, do it in a separate mapping function, not the schema.
- Modifiability: when adding new fields, default them to `nullable().optional()`. Consumers should read defensively.

## Testing
- Mock AI SDK to return valid/invalid shapes; assert Zod validation outcomes.
- Verify DB persistence path by mocking `DatabaseClient` in handler unit tests.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-14

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Excellent implementation** that demonstrates strong technical architecture and comprehensive testing. The implementation leverages a sophisticated `ReasonedField` wrapper pattern that goes beyond the basic requirements, providing structured reasoning and confidence scoring for each field. The weighted confidence calculation system with configurable category weights shows thoughtful design for production scalability.

The Zod schema design is well-architected for evolution, and the structured output implementation using AI SDK demonstrates solid understanding of modern TypeScript patterns. All files follow consistent patterns and the test coverage is comprehensive across all acceptance criteria.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was necessary. The code quality is already at production standards with clear patterns, proper error handling, and comprehensive test coverage.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ Follows TypeScript 5.6.2 patterns, structured console logging, proper error handling
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Co-located test files, proper module organization, follows established patterns
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ Comprehensive unit testing with Vitest, proper mocking, all ACs covered
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ All 8 acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested

### Improvements Checklist

**All items already addressed by implementation:**
- [x] Schema fields exactly match specified types and nullable/optional requirements
