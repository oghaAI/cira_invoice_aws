**Runtime:** Node.js 20.17.0 with TypeScript 5.6.2
**HTTP Client:** Native fetch for external calls (URL validation)
**Database:** Direct SQL queries via existing PostgreSQL connection
**Validation:** Basic native validation (no external libraries for MVP)

### Database Integration Details
[Source: Story 1.3 completion notes]

**Connection Method:**
- Use existing RDS Proxy connection from packages/infrastructure/src/stacks/database-stack.ts
- Database credentials from AWS Secrets Manager
- Connection pooling handled automatically by RDS Proxy (max: 10)

**Jobs Table Schema:**
```sql
-- From Story 1.3 implementation
CREATE TABLE jobs (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    client_id VARCHAR(50), -- From API Gateway context
    status job_status DEFAULT 'queued',
    pdf_url VARCHAR(2048) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    completed_at TIMESTAMP,

## Decision Log: Hono Framework Adoption

**Context:** For Story 1.4 we implemented basic endpoints using a single Lambda handler (`packages/api/src/handlers/job-management.ts`) with manual routing based on `httpMethod` and `resource`. The story initially suggested adopting Hono and splitting routes.

**Decision:** Defer adopting Hono for MVP. Current implementation satisfies acceptance criteria with lower complexity and zero new dependencies.

**Customer Impact:** None. Hono is an internal implementation detail; API Gateway keeps the public API stable. Deferring Hono does not change customer-facing endpoints or behavior.

**Rationale (Why Defer Now):**
- Small surface area: Only a few endpoints; manual routing is straightforward.
- Simplicity: Fewer dependencies and moving parts for early delivery.
- Existing infra: API Gateway handles auth (API keys) and CORS; Hono adds limited value here for MVP.

**What Hono Would Add (Value Later):**
- Routing/middleware: Cleaner route definitions and reusable middleware (auth, logging, CORS, validation).
- Type-safety + validation: Strongly typed params/bodies and easy schema validation via `@hono/zod-validator`.
- Centralized error handling: Consistent 4xx/5xx mapping and JSON error format in one place.
- Testing DX: `app.request()` for fast, framework-level tests without Lambda boilerplate.
- OpenAPI: Easier alignment with OpenAPI generation and typed contracts.
- Performance: Very small footprint and Lambda-friendly cold starts.

**Costs/Risks:**
- Adds dependencies (hono + AWS adapter) and a small wrapper.
- Requires light refactor of handler entrypoint and tests.
- Not strictly necessary until route count/middleware complexity grows.

**Adoption Triggers (When to Revisit):**
- Endpoint count grows (> 6 routes) or multiple handlers need shared middleware.
- Need for stronger typed contracts or OpenAPI generation.
- Requirement for centralized validation/error-handling patterns.
- Multiple teams contributing to API, requiring standardized structure.

**Migration Plan (Future Refactor):**
1. Add deps: `hono` and AWS Lambda adapter.
2. Create `packages/api/src/app.ts` exporting a Hono `app` with routes:
   - `POST /jobs`, `GET /jobs/{id}`, `GET /jobs/{id}/status`, `GET /`.
3. Factor route handlers into modules: `handlers/jobs.ts`, `handlers/status.ts`, `handlers/health.ts`.
4. Add middleware: logging, error translator, validation.
5. Export Lambda handler from adapter, update CDK `entry` to the new handler file.
6. Update tests to use `app.request()` for unit tests; keep integration tests for Lambda/APIGW as-is.

**Linked Tasks:**
- Update Task 1 items to reflect deferment (see checklist above).
- Create a follow-up story: “Adopt Hono router and modularize API handlers”.
