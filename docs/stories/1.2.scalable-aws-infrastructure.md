## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1, the project foundation is complete with:
- Monorepo structure with packages/api/, packages/database/, packages/infrastructure/
- AWS CDK 2.214.0 configured with environment-specific settings
- TypeScript strict mode enabled across all packages
- GitHub Actions CI/CD with staging and production workflows

### MVP Architecture Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture-mvp.md]

**Technology Stack:**
- AWS CDK 2.158.0 for Infrastructure as Code
- PostgreSQL 16.4 as single data store (no Redis/caching)
- AWS Step Functions for simple 3-state workflow orchestration
- API Gateway V2 with Lambda proxy integration
- CloudWatch for basic monitoring and logging

**Infrastructure Simplifications:**
- Single AWS region (us-east-1) deployment
- Basic error handling (no complex retry libraries)
- Simple push-to-deploy via CDK
- Manual rollback strategy (<30 minutes)

**Performance Requirements:**
[Source: docs/prd-mvp.md]
- Handle 3,000 invoices/day (90,000/month)
- Support 125+ concurrent requests (peak hourly load)
- Auto-scale Lambda functions and database connections
- Maintain 99.9% uptime during business hours
- Process invoices within 2-minute average timeframe

### Database Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture-mvp.md#database-schema]

**Database Schema (Simplified):**
- api_keys table: id, key_value, name, is_active, created_at
- jobs table: id, api_key_id, status, pdf_url, created_at, updated_at, error_message
- job_results table: id, job_id, extracted_data JSONB, confidence_score, tokens_used, created_at

**Required Indexes:**
- idx_jobs_status ON jobs(status)
- idx_jobs_created_at ON jobs(created_at)
- idx_job_results_job_id ON job_results(job_id)

- **Focus**: Happy path testing, integration tests for infrastructure validation
- **Test Infrastructure**: Docker PostgreSQL for local testing

**Testing Requirements:**
- Test CDK stack synthesis and deployment
- Validate database connectivity and schema creation
