# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Achieve 95%+ accuracy in invoice data extraction through dual-LLM verification system
- Reduce invoice processing time from 15-30 minutes to under 2 minutes per invoice  
- Enable scalable processing of 10,000+ invoices/month through queue-based architecture
- Provide cost-transparent processing with detailed per-job cost attribution
- Deliver API-first solution that integrates seamlessly with existing document workflows
- Establish foundation for $50K ARR within 12 months through mid-market customer acquisition

## Background Context
CIRA addresses the critical operational bottleneck faced by mid-market organizations processing 50-500 invoices monthly. Current manual workflows consume 15-30 minutes per invoice with 2-5% error rates, creating scaling limitations that require linear staff increases. Existing solutions either lack invoice-specific intelligence (generic OCR) or require complex enterprise integrations with high upfront costs.

The system leverages URL-based PDF processing through a queue architecture, combining Docling OCR with dual-LLM validation to achieve enterprise-grade accuracy while maintaining API simplicity. Built on AWS infrastructure with Step Functions orchestration, CIRA provides the missing link between document management systems and accounting software, enabling organizations to handle 3x invoice volume without additional staff.
