# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
API-first experience with clean, minimal dashboard for job monitoring and cost tracking. The interface should feel like a developer tool - fast, informative, and data-dense without unnecessary visual complexity. Primary focus on operational visibility rather than consumer-friendly design.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Job-Centric Navigation:** All interactions revolve around job submission, monitoring, and results retrieval
- **Polling-Based Updates:** Real-time status updates through automatic refresh rather than push notifications
- **Data Export Focus:** Easy CSV/JSON export of processing results and cost reports for integration with accounting workflows
- **API Documentation Integrated:** In-app API explorer and documentation for developer self-service

## Core Screens and Views
- **Job Dashboard:** Real-time view of active jobs with status, timing, and cost information
- **Job Detail Page:** Individual job results with extracted data, confidence scores, and processing timeline
- **API Keys Management:** Generate, revoke, and monitor API key usage and permissions
- **Cost Analytics:** Monthly processing costs, usage trends, and per-job cost breakdown
- **Account Settings:** Basic account management and notification preferences

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
Standard web accessibility compliance for business tool usage - keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, sufficient color contrast for data visualization.

## Branding
Clean, professional developer tool aesthetic. Minimal branding to maintain focus on functionality. Consistent with modern API service interfaces (similar to Stripe Dashboard or AWS Console styling).

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Desktop-first responsive design optimized for business users on laptops/desktops, with mobile-friendly responsive breakpoints for job monitoring on mobile devices.
