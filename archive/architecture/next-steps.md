# Next Steps

## Architect Prompt
Use this architecture document to begin Epic 1 development with the Dev agent. The document provides:
- Complete technology stack with specific versions
- Database schema ready for implementation
- Component interfaces for Lambda functions
- Security requirements for production deployment
- Testing standards for quality assurance

Key handoff requirements:
1. Set up monorepo structure as defined in Source Tree
2. Implement database schema using the provided SQL
3. Create Lambda functions following the component specifications  
4. Use OpenAPI spec for API contract implementation
5. Follow coding standards and testing requirements exactly as specified

The architecture supports all PRD requirements and is ready for immediate development.
