Your Tier 1/Baseline allowance provides for basic needs at an affordable price and encourages conservation. Your allowance is assigned based on the climate where you live, the season and your heat source. As you use more energy, you pay more for usage. Any usage over your baseline allowance will be charged at a higher price.\n\n**Wildfire Fund Charge:** Charge on behalf of the State of California Department of Water Resources (DWR) to fund the California Wildfire Fund. For usage prior to October 1, 2020, this charge included costs related to the 2001 California energy crisis, also collected on behalf of the DWR. These charges belong to DWR, not PG&E.\n\n\""PG&E\"" refers to Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a subsidiary of PG&E Corporation. © 2024 Pacific Gas and Electric Company.

'Above market' refers to the difference between what the utility pays for electric generation and current market prices for the sale of those resources. Visit www.pge.com/cca.\n\n**Wildfire Hardening Charge**: PG&E has been permitted to issue bonds that enable it to recover more quickly certain costs related to preventing and mitigating catastrophic wildfires, while reducing the total cost to its customers. Your bill for electric service includes a fixed recovery charge called the Wildfire Hardening Charge that has been approved by the CPUC to repay those bonds. The right to recover the Wildfire Hardening Charge has been transferred to a separate entity (called the Special Purpose Entity) that issued the bonds and does not belong to PG&E. PG&E is collecting the Wildfire Hardening Charge on behalf of the Special Purpose Entity. For details visit: www.pge.com/tariffs/assets/pdf/tariffbook/ELEC_PRELIM_IF.pdf.\n\n**Recovery Bond Charge/Credit**: Your bill for electric service includes a charge that has been approved by the CPUC to repay bonds issued for certain costs related to catastrophic wildfires. The Recovery Bond Charge (RBC) rate is currently $0.00597 per kWh. PG&E has also contributed certain amounts to a trust fund which is used to provide a customer credit equal to $0.00597 per kWh (Recovery Bond Credit). The right to recover the RBC has been transferred to one or more Special Purpose Entities that issued the bonds and does not belong to PG&E. PG&E is collecting that portion of the RBC on behalf of the Special Purpose Entities.\n\n**Gas Public Purpose Program (PPP) Surcharge**: Used to fund state-mandated gas assistance programs for low-income customers, energy efficiency programs, and public-interest research and development.\n\nVisit www.pge.com/billexplanation for more definitions.

The likelihood of you being assessed a deposit may increase if you fail to pay the Past Due Amount below by the payment date of 08/08/2024.

You'll also be subject to a TDU disconnection fee of up to $193.95. You may also be charged a TXU Energy disconnect recovery charge of $25.00 depending on your terms of service.\n- your electricity service is disconnected and not restored with TXU Energy?\n- Any deposit you have with us will be applied against your final bill. If the deposit doesn't satisfy your outstanding balance, we'll begin appropriate collection procedures for the amount owed including the use of consumer reporting agencies, debt collection agencies and, to the extent allowed by law, possible assessment of collection fees, attorney's fees, court costs, and interest. If your deposit amount exceeds the amount of your final bill, the remaining amount will be returned to you or transferred to your new Retail Electric Provider (REP) if TXU Energy, your new REP, and you all consent to the transfer.\n- you need help paying by the Payment Date, or are ill and unable to pay?\n- You may be able to make an alternate payment arrangement, establish a deferred payment plan, or possibly secure payment assistance from state and federal energy assistance programs.

Tier 1/Baseline allowance: Some residential rates are given a Tier 1/Baseline allowance - a CPUC approved percentage of average customer usage during summer and winter months. Your Tier 1/Baseline allowance provides for basic needs at an affordable price and encourages conservation. Your allowance is assigned based on the climate where you live, the season and your heat source. As you use more energy, you pay more for usage. Any usage over your baseline allowance will be charged at a higher price. Wildfire Fund Charge: Charge on behalf of the State of California Department of Water Resources (DWR) to fund the California Wildfire Fund. For usage prior to October 1, 2020, this charge included costs related to the 2001 California energy crisis, also collected on behalf of the DWR. These charges belong to DWR, not PG\\&E. \""PG\\&E\"" refers to Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a subsidiary of PG\\&E Corporation. (c) 2024 Pacific Gas and Electric Company. All rights reserved.

'Above market' refers to the difference between what the utility pays for electric generation and current market prices for the sale of those resources. Visit www.pge.com/cca. Wildfire Hardening Charge: PG\\&E has been permitted to issue bonds that enable it to recover more quickly certain costs related to preventing and mitigating catastrophic wildfires, while reducing the total cost to its customers. Your bill for electric service includes a fixed recovery charge called the Wildfire Hardening Charge that has been approved by the CPUC to repay those bonds. The right to recover the Wildfire Hardening Charge has been transferred to a separate entity (called the Special Purpose Entity) that issued the bonds and does not belong to PG\\&E. PG\\&E is collecting the Wildfire Hardening Charge on behalf of the Special Purpose Entity. For details visit: www.pge.com/tariffs/assets/pdf/tariffbook/ELEC_PRELIM_IF.pdf. Recovery Bond Charge/Credit: Your bill for electric service includes a charge that has been approved by the CPUC to repay bonds issued for certain costs related to catastrophic wildfires. The Recovery Bond Charge (RBC) rate is currently $\\$ 0.00597$ per kWh . PG\\&E has also contributed certain amounts to a trust fund which is used to provide a customer credit equal to $\\$ 0.00597$ per kWh (Recovery Bond Credit). The right to recover the RBC has been transferred to one or more Special Purpose Entities that issued the bonds and does not belong to PG\\&E. PG\\&E is collecting that portion of the RBC on behalf of the Special Purpose Entities. Gas Public Purpose Program (PPP) Surcharge. Used to fund state-mandated gas assistance programs for low-income customers, energy efficiency programs, and public-interest research and development.

To learn more about optional rates or view a complete list of rules and rates, visit www.pge.com or call 1-800-743-5000. If you believe there is an error on your bill, please call 1-800-743-5000 to speak with a representative. If you are not satisfied with our response, contact the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), Consumer Affairs Branch (CAB), 505 Van Ness Avenue, Room 2003, San Francisco, CA 94102, 1-800-649-7570 or 7-1-1 (8:30 AM to 4:30 PM, Monday through Friday) or by visiting www.cpuc.ca.gov/complaints/.\n\nTo avoid having service turned off while you wait for the outcome of a complaint to the CPUC specifically regarding the accuracy of your bill, please contact CAB for assistance. If your case meets the eligibility criteria, CAB will provide you with instructions on how to mail a check or money order to be impounded pending resolution of your case. You must continue to pay your current charges while your complaint is under review to keep your service turned on.\n\nIf you are not able to pay your bill, call PG&E to discuss how we can help. You may qualify for reduced rates under PG&E's CARE program or other special programs and agencies may be available to assist you. You may qualify for PG&E's Energy Savings Assistance Program which is an energy efficiency program for income-qualified residential customers.\n\n## Important definitions\n\nRotating outage blocks are subject to change without advance notice due to operational conditions.\n\n**Tier 1/Baseline allowance:** Some residential rates are given a Tier 1/Baseline allowance - a CPUC approved percentage of average customer usage during summer and winter months. Your Tier 1/Baseline allowance provides for basic needs at an affordable price and encourages conservation. Your allowance is assigned based on the climate where you live, the season and your heat source. As you use more energy, you pay more for usage. Any usage over your baseline allowance will be charged at a higher price.\n\n**Wildfire Fund Charge:** Charge on behalf of the State of California Department of Water Resources (DWR) to fund the California Wildfire Fund. For usage prior to October 1, 2020, this charge included costs related to the 2001 California energy crisis, also collected on behalf of the DWR.

'Above market' refers to the difference between what the utility pays for electric generation and current market prices for the sale of those resources. Visit www.pge.com/cca.\n\n**Wildfire Hardening Charge**: PG&E has been permitted to issue bonds that enable it to recover more quickly certain costs related to preventing and mitigating catastrophic wildfires, while reducing the total cost to its customers. Your bill for electric service includes a fixed recovery charge called the Wildfire Hardening Charge that has been approved by the CPUC to repay those bonds. The right to recover the Wildfire Hardening Charge has been transferred to a separate entity (called the Special Purpose Entity) that issued the bonds and does not belong to PG&E. PG&E is collecting the Wildfire Hardening Charge on behalf of the Special Purpose Entity. For details visit: www.pge.com/fariffs/assets/pdf/fariffbook/ELEC_PRELIM_IF.pdf.\n\n**Recovery Bond Charge/Credit**: Your bill for electric service includes a charge that has been approved by the CPUC to repay bonds issued for certain costs related to catastrophic wildfires. The Recovery Bond Charge (RBC) rate is currently $0.00597 per kWh. PG&E has also contributed certain amounts to a trust fund which is used to provide a customer credit equal to $0.00597 per kWh (Recovery Bond Credit). The right to recover the RBC has been transferred to one or more Special Purpose Entities that issued the bonds and does not belong to PG&E. PG&E is collecting that portion of the RBC on behalf of the Special Purpose Entities.\n\n**Gas Public Purpose Program (PPP) Surcharge**: Used to fund state-mandated gas assistance programs for low-income customers, energy efficiency programs, and public-interest research and development.\n\nVisit www.pge.com/billexplanation for more definitions.

Tier 1/Baseline allowance: Some residential rates are given a Tier 1/Baseline allowance - a CPUC approved percentage of average customer usage during summer and winter months. Your Tier 1/Baseline allowance provides for basic needs at an affordable price and encourages conservation. Your allowance is assigned based on the climate where you live, the season and your heat source. As you use more energy, you pay more for usage. Any usage over your baseline allowance will be charged at a higher price. Wildfire Fund Charge: Charge on behalf of the State of California Department of Water Resources (DWR) to fund the California Wildfire Fund. For usage prior to October 1, 2020, this charge included costs related to the 2001 California energy crisis, also collected on behalf of the DWR. These charges belong to DWR, not PG\\&E. \""PG\\&E\"" refers to Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a subsidiary of PG\\&E Corporation. (c) 2024 Pacific Gas and Electric Company. All rights reserved.

'Above market' refers to the difference between what the utility pays for electric generation and current market prices for the sale of those resources. Visit www.pge.com/cca. Wildfire Hardening Charge: PG\\&E has been permitted to issue bonds that enable it to recover more quickly certain costs related to preventing and mitigating catastrophic wildfires, while reducing the total cost to its customers. Your bill for electric service includes a fixed recovery charge called the Wildfire Hardening Charge that has been approved by the CPUC to repay those bonds. The right to recover the Wildfire Hardening Charge has been transferred to a separate entity (called the Special Purpose Entity) that issued the bonds and does not belong to PG\\&E. PG\\&E is collecting the Wildfire Hardening Charge on behalf of the Special Purpose Entity. For details visit: www.pge.com/tariffs/assets/pdf/tariffbook/ELEC_PRELIM_IF.pdf. Recovery Bond Charge/Credit: Your bill for electric service includes a charge that has been approved by the CPUC to repay bonds issued for certain costs related to catastrophic wildfires. The Recovery Bond Charge (RBC) rate is currently $\\$ 0.00597$ per kWh . PG\\&E has also contributed certain amounts to a trust fund which is used to provide a customer credit equal to $\\$ 0.00597$ per kWh (Recovery Bond Credit). The right to recover the RBC has been transferred to one or more Special Purpose Entities that issued the bonds and does not belong to PG\\&E. PG\\&E is collecting that portion of the RBC on behalf of the Special Purpose Entities. Gas Public Purpose Program (PPP) Surcharge. Used to fund state-mandated gas assistance programs for low-income customers, energy efficiency programs, and public-interest research and development.

Demand is a measurement of the highest usage of electricity in any single fifteen (or sometimes five) minute period during a monthly billing cycle. Demand is measured in kilowatts (or kW). High demand is usually associated with equipment start-up. By spreading equipment start-ups over a longer period of time, you may be able to lower demand and reduce your demand charges.\n\nTime-of-use electric prices are higher every day during afternoons and evenings, and lower at other times of the day. Prices also change by season, with higher prices in the summer and lower prices in the winter.\n\nWildfire Fund Charge: Charge on behalf of the State of California Department of Water Resources (DWR) to fund the California Wildfire Fund. For usage prior to October 1, 2020, this charge included costs related to the 2001 California energy crisis, also collected on behalf of the DWR. These charges belong to DWR, not PG&E.\n\n|  Dijch vu khách tiếng Việt (Vietnamese) | 1-800-298-8438  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Business Customer Service | 1-800-468-4743  |\n\nPower Charge Indifference Adjustment (PCIA): The PCIA is a charge to ensure that both PG&E customers and those who have left PG&E service to purchase electricity from other providers pay for the above market costs for electric generation resources that were procured by PG&E on their behalf. 'Above market' refers to the difference between what the utility pays for electric generation and current market prices for the sale of those resources. Visit www.pge.com/cca.\n\nWildfire Hardening Charge: PG&E has been permitted to issue bonds that enable it to recover more quickly certain costs related to preventing and mitigating catastrophic wildfires, while reducing the total cost to its customers. Your bill for electric service includes a fixed recovery charge called the Wildfire Hardening Charge that has been approved by the CPUC to repay those bonds. The right to recover the Wildfire Hardening Charge has been transferred to a separate entity (called the Special Purpose Entity) that issued the bonds and does not belong to PG&E. PG&E is collecting the Wildfire Hardening Charge on behalf of the Special Purpose Entity. For details visit: www.pge.com/fariffs/assets/pdf/fariffbook/ELEC_PRELIM_IF.pdf.\n\nRecovery Bond Charge/Credit: Your bill for electric service includes a charge that has been approved by the CPUC to repay bonds issued for certain costs related to catastrophic wildfires. The Recovery Bond Charge (RBC) rate is currently $\\$ 0.00650$ per kWh. PG&E has also contributed certain amounts to a trust fund which is used to provide a customer credit equal to $\\$ 0.00650$ per kWh (Recovery Bond Credit). The right to recover the RBC has been transferred to one or more Special Purpose Entities that issued the bonds and does not belong to PG&E.

Tier 1/Baseline allowance: Some residential rates are given a Tier 1/Baseline allowance - a CPUC approved percentage of average customer usage during summer and winter months. Your Tier 1/Baseline allowance provides for basic needs at an affordable price and encourages conservation. Your allowance is assigned based on the climate where you live, the season and your heat source. As you use more energy, you pay more for usage. Any usage over your baseline allowance will be charged at a higher price. Wildfire Fund Charge: Charge on behalf of the State of California Department of Water Resources (DWR) to fund the California Wildfire Fund. For usage prior to October 1, 2020, this charge included costs related to the 2001 California energy crisis, also collected on behalf of the DWR. These charges belong to DWR, not PG\\&E. \""PG\\&E\"" refers to Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a subsidiary of PG\\&E Corporation. (c) 2024 Pacific Gas and Electric Company. All rights reserved.

'Above market' refers to the difference between what the utility pays for electric generation and current market prices for the sale of those resources. Visit www.pge.com/cca. Wildfire Hardening Charge: PG\\&E has been permitted to issue bonds that enable it to recover more quickly certain costs related to preventing and mitigating catastrophic wildfires, while reducing the total cost to its customers. Your bill for electric service includes a fixed recovery charge called the Wildfire Hardening Charge that has been approved by the CPUC to repay those bonds. The right to recover the Wildfire Hardening Charge has been transferred to a separate entity (called the Special Purpose Entity) that issued the bonds and does not belong to PG\\&E. PG\\&E is collecting the Wildfire Hardening Charge on behalf of the Special Purpose Entity. For details visit: www.pge.com/tariffs/assets/pdf/tariffbook/ELEC_PRELIM_IF.pdf. Recovery Bond Charge/Credit: Your bill for electric service includes a charge that has been approved by the CPUC to repay bonds issued for certain costs related to catastrophic wildfires. The Recovery Bond Charge (RBC) rate is currently $\\$ 0.00650$ per kWh . PG\\&E has also contributed certain amounts to a trust fund which is used to provide a customer credit equal to $\\$ 0.00650$ per kWh (Recovery Bond Credit). The right to recover the RBC has been transferred to one or more Special Purpose Entities that issued the bonds and does not belong to PG\\&E.

If your case meets the eligibility criteria, CAB will provide you with instructions on how to mail a check or money order to be impounded pending resolution of your case. You must continue to pay your current charges while your complaint is under review to keep your service turned on.\n\nIf you are not able to pay your bill, call PG&E to discuss how we can help. You may qualify for reduced rates under PG&E's CARE program or other special programs and agencies may be available to assist you.

Your Tier 1/Baseline allowance provides for basic needs at an affordable price and encourages conservation. Your allowance is assigned based on the climate where you live, the season and your heat source. As you use more energy, you pay more for usage. Any usage over your baseline allowance will be charged at a higher price.\n\n**Wildfire Fund Charge:** Charge on behalf of the State of California Department of Water Resources (DWR) to fund the California Wildfire Fund. For usage prior to October 1, 2020, this charge included costs related to the 2001 California energy crisis, also collected on behalf of the DWR.

If you are not satisfied with our response, contact the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), Consumer Affairs Branch (CAB), 505 Van Ness Avenue, Room 2003, San Francisco, CA 94102, 1-800-649-7570 or 7-1-1 (8:30 AM to 4:30 PM, Monday through Friday) or by visiting www.cpuc.ca.gov/complaints/.\n\nTo avoid having service turned off while you wait for the outcome of a complaint to the CPUC specifically regarding the accuracy of your bill, please contact CAB for assistance. If your case meets the eligibility criteria, CAB will provide you with instructions on how to mail a check or money order to be impounded pending resolution of your case. You must continue to pay your current charges while your complaint is under review to keep your service turned on.\n\nIf you are not able to pay your bill, call PG&E to discuss how we can help. You may qualify for reduced rates under PG&E's CARE program or other special programs and agencies may be available to assist you. You may qualify for PG&E's Energy Savings Assistance Program which is an energy efficiency program for income-qualified residential customers.\n\n**Important definitions**\n\n**Rotating outage blocks** are subject to change without advance notice due to operational conditions.\n\n**Tier 1/Baseline allowance:** Some residential rates are given a Tier 1/Baseline allowance - a CPUC approved percentage of average customer usage during summer and winter months. Your Tier 1/Baseline allowance provides for basic needs at an affordable price and encourages conservation. Your allowance is assigned based on the climate where you live, the season and your heat source. As you use more energy, you pay more for usage. Any usage over your baseline allowance will be charged at a higher price.\n\n**Wildfire Fund Charge:** Charge on behalf of the State of California Department of Water Resources (DWR) to fund the California Wildfire Fund. For usage prior to October 1, 2020, this charge included costs related to the 2001 California energy crisis, also collected on behalf of the DWR. These charges belong to DWR, not PG&E.\n\n**Power Charge Indifference Adjustment (PCIA):** The PCIA is a charge to ensure that both PG&E customers and those who have left PG&E service to purchase electricity from other providers pay for the above market costs for electric generation resources that were procured by PG&E on their behalf. 'Above market' refers to the difference between what the utility pays for electric generation and current market prices for the sale of those resources. Visit www.pge.com/cca.\n\n**Wildfire Hardening Charge:** PG&E has been permitted to issue bonds that enable it to recover more quickly certain costs related to preventing and mitigating catastrophic wildfires, while reducing the total cost to its customers. Your bill for electric service includes a fixed recovery charge called the Wildfire Hardening Charge that has been approved by the CPUC to repay those bonds. The right to recover the Wildfire Hardening Charge has been transferred to a separate entity (called the Special Purpose Entity) that issued the bonds and does not belong to PG&E. PG&E is collecting the Wildfire Hardening Charge on behalf of the Special Purpose Entity. For details visit: www.pge.com/tariffs/assets/pdf/tariffbook/ELEC_PRELIM_JF.pdf.\n\n**Recovery Bond Charge/Credit:** Your bill for electric service includes a charge that has been approved by the CPUC to repay bonds issued for certain costs related to catastrophic wildfires. The Recovery Bond Charge (RBC) rate is currently $0.00650 per kWh. PG&E has also contributed certain amounts to a trust fund which is used to provide a customer credit equal to $0.00650 per kWh (Recovery Bond Credit). The right to recover the RBC has been transferred to one or more Special Purpose Entities that issued the bonds and does not belong to PG&E. PG&E is collecting that portion of the RBC on behalf of the Special Purpose Entities.\n\n**Gas Public Purpose Program (PPP) Surcharge:** Used to fund state-mandated gas assistance programs for low-income customers, energy efficiency programs, and public-interest research and development.\n\nVisit www.pge.com/billexplanation for more definitions.

Whether you're digging at home or for a commercial construction project, call Miss Utility at 811 before you dig. Call at least two full business days (but not more than 10 days) before you begin any project, from home landscaping and gardening to large construction jobs.

Using more energy drives up variable costs that customers pay per kWh (how electricity is measured) or therm (how gas is measured). These variable costs include, but are not limited to:\n\n![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)\n\n- The total cost of the electricity or gas that you use\n- The regulated distribution charge\n- The EmPOWER Maryland charge\n\nVisit bge.com/heretohelp for ways to manage your bill, use energy more efficiently, or access energy assistance.\n\nFor more details, or to view BGE's Understanding Your Bill video, visit bge.com/billsupport.\n\n![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)\n\n---\n\n## EVsmart\n\nGreat news: If you're a Net Metering (solar) or Budget Billing customer with an electric vehicle, you're now eligible to enroll in the Vehicle Charging TOU Rate.

Whether you're digging at home or for a commercial construction project, call Miss Utility at 811 before you dig. Call at least two full business days (but not more than 10 days) before you begin any project, from home landscaping and gardening to large construction jobs. Representatives will visit your proposed dig site and mark the locations of underground electrical wires, gas pipelines and other utilities. For additional information, visit bge.com/811.\n\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\n## High winter energy bills\n\nYour heating system works harder to keep your home warm during the cold winter months, and that is the primary contributor to higher seasonal energy bills. Using more energy drives up variable costs that customers pay per kWh (how electricity is measured) or therm (how gas is measured). These variable costs include, but are not limited to:\n\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\n\n- The total cost of the electricity or gas that you use\n- The regulated distribution charge\n- The EmPOWER Maryland charge\n\nVisit bge.com/heretohelp for ways to manage your bill, use energy more efficiently, or access energy assistance.\n\nFor more details, or to view BGE's Understanding Your Bill video, visit bge.com/billsupport.\n\n![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)\n\n---\n\n## EVsmart\n\nGreat news: If you're a Net Metering (solar) or Budget Billing customer with an electric vehicle, you're now eligible to enroll in the Vehicle Charging TOU Rate.

Visit bge.com/VehicleCharging TOU to enroll.\n![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)\n\n## Tree trimming\n\nWhen trimming trees, please keep the following in mind:\n\n- Do not climb trees or trim trees that are located near power lines.\n- Maintain a minimum of 10 feet of clearance from energized lines. Assume all lines are energized!\n- Hiring a qualified licensed contractor who is familiar with the safety requirements is a safer alternative.\n- Always keep children away from trees that are near power lines.\n\nVisit bge.com/TreeCare for more information on tree trimming.\n![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)\n\n# Natural gas safety \n\nGas is colorless, tasteless, and odorless in its natural state. Therefore, BGE puts mercaptan, a safety additive in natural gas to give it a rotten egg odor and make it easier to desect. When you call, BGE will respond promptly to survey the area, perform safety measures, and repair BGE's equipment. There is no charge to investigate a gas leak. If you detect a natural gas leak, leave immediately and go to a safe place, at least 100 feet away, then call 911 OR 877.778.7798. Visit bge.com/GasSafety for more natural gas safety information.\n![img-7.jpeg](img-7.jpeg)\n\nMERCAPTAN\n![img-8.jpeg](img-8.jpeg)\n\nSMELLS LIKE\n![img-9.jpeg](img-9.jpeg)\n\nROTTEN EGGS"",""temp_url"":null}","Document layout is clear, but community name is ambiguous.",true,BGE,2025-04-23,utility,-165.07,7219236922,,0129518,,,-165.07,,false,,,BGE,48.28,"BGE P.O.

We subtract any Payments Received/Adjustments and add your Current Charges from this billing cycle to get a Total Due on this invoice.

For each returned check, a charge will be assessed on your next invoice equal to the maximum amount permitted by applicable state law.\n\n### Check Here to Change Contact Info\n\n- List your new billing information below. For a change of service address, please contact **WM**.\n\n### Check Here to Sign Up for Automatic Payment Enrollment\n\n- If I enroll in Automatic Payment services, I authorize **WM** to pay my invoice by electronically deducting money from my bank account. I can cancel authorization by notifying **WM** at **wm.com** or by calling the customer service number listed on my invoice. Your enrollment could take 1-2 billing cycles for Automatic Payments to take effect.

Here are safety basics everyone should know in the rare event of a natural gas leak.\n\n*¿Sabía que podría haber tuberías de gas natural en su zona? Aquí hay los conceptos básicos de seguridad que todos deberían conocer en el raro caso de una fuga de gas natural.*\n\n## How to Contact Florida City Gas in an Emergency\n\n*Cómo Comunicarse con Florida City Gas en Caso de Emergencia*\n\n![img-2.jpeg](img-2.jpeg)\n\nFCG's Emergency Response Team is available 24/7. If you suspect a gas leak or related emergency, please call FCG at **888.352.5325** after you've cleared the location.\n\n*El Equipo de Respuesta Ante Emergencias de FCG está disponible las 24 horas del día, los 7 días de la semana. Si sospecha que hay una fuga de gas o una emergencia similar, llame a FCG al **888.352.5325** después de haber desalojado el lugar.*\n\n## Transmission Pipelines\n\n### Tuberías de Transmisión\n\nPipeline markers along mains and transmission lines have phone numbers in case of emergency. They don't show exact locations/depths, so please call 811 to locate and mark utility lines. Some segments along transmission pipelines may be designated as High Consequence Areas (HCAs). Call **888.352.5325** for FCG's Emergency Response Team.\n\n*Los marcadores de tuberías a lo largo de las líneas principales y de transmisión tienen números de teléfono en caso de emergencia. No muestran las ubicaciones/profundidades exactas, así que debe llamar al 811 para localizar y marcar las líneas de servicios públicos. Algunos segmentos a lo largo de las tuberías de transmisión pueden denominarse zonas de graves consecuencias (HCA, por sus siglas en inglés). Llame al **888.352.5325** para más información del Equipo de Respuesta Ante Emergencias de FCG.*\n\n## Call 811 Before You Dig\n\n*Antes de Excavar, Llame al 811*\n\nIf you don't call 811 before you dig, you may hit underground utility lines, which can result in potential injury or worse. Before you pick up a shovel, pick up the phone and call 811 to have your lines marked for free. Not only is it the safe and smart thing to do — it's the law!\n\n*Si no llama al 811 antes de excavar, puede golpear las líneas subterráneas de los servicios públicos, lo que puede causar posibles lesiones o algo peor. Antes de recoger la pala, llame al 811 para que le marquen las tuberías de gratis. No solo es lo más seguro y sensato, ¡sino que lo exige la ley!*\n\n![img-3.jpeg](img-3.jpeg)\n\n![img-4.jpeg](img-4.jpeg)\n\n**FloridaCityGas.com | 888.352.5325**\n\n![img-5.jpeg](img-5.jpeg)\n\n---\n\n# How To Recognize A Leak\n## Cómo Detectar Una Fuga\n\nNatural gas is under pressure when running through pipelines. Because natural gas is lighter than air, it rises when it escapes. Natural gas emergencies are uncommon, but you should be able to recognize the signs of a potential leak.\n\n*El gas natural se encuentra bajo presión cuando circula por las tuberías. Dado que el gas natural es más ligero que el aire, se eleva cuando se escapa. Las emergencias causadas por el gas natural son raras, pero usted debe poder identificar las señales de una posible fuga.*\n\n![img-6.jpeg](img-6.jpeg)\n\nNatural gas is naturally odorless. A 'rotten egg' odor is added for easy detection.\n\n*El gas natural es inodoro por naturaleza. Se añade un olor a 'huevo podrido' para facilitar la detección.*\n\n![img-7.jpeg](img-7.jpeg)\n\nLook out for blowing dirt or bubbling creeks or ponds. Natural gas is lighter than air and rises.\n\n*Preste atención a la tierra que se eleva en el aire o a los arroyos o estanques burbujeantes. El gas natural es más ligero que el aire y se eleva.*\n\n![img-8.jpeg](img-8.jpeg)\n\nListen for hissing sounds near a gas appliance or line.\n\n*Compruebe si hay sonidos de sisear cerca de un electrodoméstico de gas o una tubería.*\n\n# If You Smell Gas...\n## Si Huele a Gas...\n\n### DO NOT\n### NO HAGA LO SIGUIENTE\n\n- Smoke, light a match or do anything that may cause a spark, which may result in an explosion or fire.\n- *Fumar, encender una cerilla o hacer cualquier cosa que pueda causar una chispa, lo cual puede causar una explosión o un incendio.*\n- Try to find or stop the leak. *Tratar de encontrar o detener la fuga.*\n- Use a cell phone or telephone until securely outside the location. *Utilizar un teléfono celular o teléfono fijo hasta que se encuentre en un lugar seguro.*\n- Turn on or off any electric switches. *Encender o apagar cualquier interruptor eléctrico.*\n- Ring the doorbell or open any garage doors. *Tocar el timbre o abrir cualquier puerta de garaje.*\n\n### DO\n### HAGA LO SIGUIENTE\n\n- LEAVE THE AREA IMMEDIATELY. *ABANDONE LA ZONA DE INMEDIATO.*\n- Call FCG at **888.352.5325** once you are at a safe distance (or dial 911 if needed). *Llame a FCG al 888.352.5325 una vez que esté a una distancia segura (o llame al 911 si es necesario).*\n\n# Maintaining Gas Lines\n## Mantenimiento de Tuberías de Gas\n\nFCG is required under federal and state regulations to maintain natural gas service lines up to and including the gas meter. Beyond the meter, the maintenance of any piping (gas fuel lines) is the responsibility of the customer or property owner. Sometimes, a customer's piping may be underground. If customers do not maintain their underground gas lines, the piping may corrode and leak, causing a potential safety hazard. This gas piping should be periodically inspected for leaks, and metal pipes should also be inspected for corrosion. Ask about our Fuel Line Maintenance program, as well as Gas Line Coverage available through HomeServe USA.\n\n*FCG tiene la obligación de cumplir con las regulaciones federales y estatales para mantener las líneas de servicio de gas natural hasta e incluyendo el contador de gas. Aparte del medidorcontador, el mantenimiento de las tuberías (conductos de gas combustible) es responsabilidad del cliente o del propietario. A veces, las tuberías de un cliente pueden ser subterráneas. Si los clientes no mantienen sus tuberías de gas subterráneas, pueden corroerse y producirse fugas, causando un posible riesgo de seguridad. Estas tuberías de gas deben ser inspeccionadas periódicamente en busca de fugas, y las tuberías metálicas también deben ser inspeccionadas en busca de corrosión.
