taxes in Texas are assessed as of January 1st of each year and cover a period of one year from that date. Tax statutes make no provisions for proration; therefore, a change of address during the year would have no effect on the tax liability established on January 1st of the calendar year. These tax statutes also make no provisions for proration in case the property is disposed of during the calendar year. Also, if you owned personal property described on the tax statement on January 1st, then you are personally liable for the taxes. IF YOU ARE 65 YEARS OR OLDER, DISABLED OR A DISABLED VETERAN AND YOU OCCUPY THE PROPERTY DESCRIBED IN THIS DOCUMENT AS YOUR RESIDENCE HOMESTEAD, YOU SHOULD CONTACT THE APPRAISAL DISTRICT REGARDING ANY ENTITLEMENT YOU MAY HAVE TO A POSTPONEMENT IN THE PAYMENT OF THESE TAXES.\n\nTotal Tax Due may include Additional Penalty up to 20% incurred on April 1 or July 1 of the year of delinquency (Tax Code Section 33.11) or Additional Late AG Penalty of 10% (Tax Code Section 23.54).\n\n**TOTAL TAX APPRAISAL DISTRICT OF BELL COUNTY**\n\n**PO BOX 390**\n\n**BELTON, TX 76513-0390**\n\n**PETACH HERE AND

It is your right to file an Ad Valorem Real Property Tax Return with the BOA between January 1 and April 1 of the tax year to declare your own estimate of your property's value. You also have the right to appeal the value on your Annual Notice of Assessement within 45 days of its postmark. For information about values and appeals, contact the BOA directly at 770-822-7200. The Tax Commissioner's Office has no role in determining property values. Note that the due date to file your value appeal with the BOA for this bill is passed.\n\nProperty you have bought or sold: If you owned property on January 1 of the tax year, you are responsible for the full year's taxes even if you sold it. If the taxes are not paid, you may be named on a tax lien. To avoid this, you must submit acceptable proof of the transfer of tax liability within 90 days of the tax due date. Visit www.GwinnettTaxCommissioner.com/sold for examples of acceptable proof. If your proof is accepted, liens for delinquent taxes will be filed in the name of the property owner as of the tax due date. If you moved to a new home in Gwinnett County, you must apply for a homestead for your new home by April 1 to reduce your taxes in the current year.\n\nHomestead Exemptions: If you own and occupy a residential property as of January 1 of the tax year, you may qualify for an exemption to reduce taxes. Special exemptions exist for qualifying seniors, the disabled, and others. Apply at www.GwinnettTaxCommissioner.com/apply. The same application is used for all homesteads exemptions. Applications must be submitted by April 1 to qualify for the current tax year. Once approved, you do not need to reapply unless there is a change to the deed or you become eligible for a different homestead. Contact the Tax Commissioner's Office if you no longer qualify for your exemption.\n\nLate Payments: Taxes not paid by the due date will accrue interest each calendar month, or any portion of a month thereof. Any amount remaining after 120 days after the due date will accrue a $5 \\%$ penalty, with an additional $5 \\%$ penalty added at 120-day intervals ( $20 \\%$ maximum). Delinquent taxes will also subject the property to a tax lien and ultimately, to sale at a tax auction to collect the remaining amount. All payments received will be applied first to the oldest amounts due.\n\n## For Assistance Call:\n\n- Tax Bills - Tax Commissioner: 770-822-8800\n- Values \\& Appeals: Tax Assessor's Office\n- Real Estate: 770-822-7200\n- Personal Property: 770-822-7220\n(Planes, Boats, Motors, Businesses)\n- County Solid Waste: 770-822-7141\n- County Street Lights \\& Speed Tables: 770-822-7400\n- County Stormwater: 678-376-7193\n- County Millage Rates: 770-822-7000\n- School Millage Rates: 678-301-6200\n- City Tax and Special Assessments - contact your city*\n*Gwinnett County receives $\\$ 1.80$ per parcel for collecting city taxes\n\n| Payment Options (we do not accept payment by phone) |\n| :-- |\n| - Pay online at www.GwinnettTaxCommissioner.com |\n| Check: No convenience fee |\n| Debit Card: Flat $\\$ 3.50$ Fee |\n| Credit Card: $2.30 \\%$ fee, $\\$ 1.50$ min.

It is your right to file an Ad Valorem Real Property Tax Return with the BOA between January 1 and April 1 of the tax year to declare your own estimate of your property's value. You also have the right to appeal the value on your Annual Notice of Assessement within 45 days of its postmark. For information about values and appeals, contact the BOA directly at 770-822-7200. The Tax Commissioner's Office has no role in determining property values. Note that the due date to file your value appeal with the BOA for this bill is passed.\n\nProperty you have bought or sold: If you owned property on January 1 of the tax year, you are responsible for the full year's taxes even if you sold it. If the taxes are not paid, you may be named on a tax lien. To avoid this, you must submit acceptable proof of the transfer of tax liability within 90 days of the tax due date. Visit www.GwinnettTaxCommissioner.com/sold for examples of acceptable proof. If your proof is accepted, liens for delinquent taxes will be filed in the name of the property owner as of the tax due date. If you moved to a new home in Gwinnett County, you must apply for a homestead for your new home by April 1 to reduce your taxes in the current year.\n\nHomestead Exemptions: If you own and occupy a residential property as of January 1 of the tax year, you may qualify for an exemption to reduce taxes. Special exemptions exist for qualifying seniors, the disabled, and others. Apply at www.GwinnettTaxCommissioner.com/apply. The same application is used for all homesteads exemptions. Applications must be submitted by April 1 to qualify for the current tax year. Once approved, you do not need to reapply unless there is a change to the deed or you become eligible for a different homestead. Contact the Tax Commissioner's Office if you no longer qualify for your exemption.\n\nLate Payments: Taxes not paid by the due date will accrue interest each calendar month, or any portion of a month thereof. Any amount remaining after 120 days after the due date will accrue a $5 \\%$ penalty, with an additional $5 \\%$ penalty added at 120-day intervals ( $20 \\%$ maximum). Delinquent taxes will also subject the property to a tax lien and ultimately, to sale at a tax auction to collect the remaining amount. All payments received will be applied first to the oldest amounts due.\n\n## For Assistance Call:\n\n- Tax Bills - Tax Commissioner: 770-822-8800\n- Values \\& Appeals: Tax Assessor's Office\n- Real Estate: 770-822-7200\n- Personal Property: 770-822-7220\n(Planes, Boats, Motors, Businesses)\n- County Solid Waste: 770-822-7141\n- County Street Lights \\& Speed Tables: 770-822-7400\n- County Stormwater: 678-376-7193\n- County Millage Rates: 770-822-7000\n- School Millage Rates: 678-301-6200\n- City Tax and Special Assessments - contact your city*\n*Gwinnett County receives $\\$ 1.80$ per parcel for collecting city taxes\n\n| Payment Options (we do not accept payment by phone) |\n| :-- |\n| - Pay online at www.GwinnettTaxCommissioner.com |\n| Check: No convenience fee |\n| Debit Card: Flat $\\$ 3.50$ Fee |\n| Credit Card: $2.30 \\%$ fee, $\\$ 1.50$ min.

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR REDEMPTION TAX BILL \n\n## ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AVAILABLE ONLINE AT WWW.CCTAX.US\n\nABOUT THIS BILL - When secured and supplemental taxes remain unpaid at the end of the fiscal year (June 30th), they become tax-defaulted. Taxdefaulted properties transfer to the redemption tax roll where they are assigned a sale ID, and begin to accrue penalties (interest) as provided by law. The defaulted taxes accrue an additional $11 / 2$ percent of penalty each month ( 18 percent per annum) until the balance is paid in full. In addition, a $\\$ 15.00$ redemption fee attaches to the defaulted amount(s).\nTAX PAYMENT: The Tax Collector's office accepts as negotiable instruments only those items drawn in U.S. dollars on U.S. Banks. The following options are available to submit your payment:\n\n- IN PERSON - Cash, checks, and credit cards* are accepted at 625 Court St., Martinez, Room 100. Office hours are 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday - Friday, holidays excluded. The installment coupons are required for payment;\n- BY MAIL - Check, cashier's check, or money order only. All checks must be made payable to Contra Costa County Tax Collector. All checks returned by the bank, for any reason, will cause the record of payment to be canceled. Penalties will be added after the delinquency date, as well as a special handling fee. (Do not mail cash. The Tax Collector disclaims any responsibility for cash sent by mail);\n- ONLINE - Credit/debit cards* and e-checks on our website at www.cctax.us. Currently, only the full redemption amount is payable on our website; installment payments are not acceptable.\n* A third-party service fee is charged for all credit and debit card transactions.\n\nPOWER TO SALE - Property that remains in tax-defaulted status for five or more years will become subject to the tax collector's power to sell. Once subject to power to sell, the property may be sold at public auction or otherwise conveyed to new ownership. The power to sell status may be avoided by initiating and maintaining an installment plan within the first five years of default, or by completely redeeming the property through payment of all unpaid amounts together with penalties and fees prescribed by law, before subject property is sold.\nAMOUNT TO REDEEM - The current total amount to redeem the property as shown on the coupon must be paid in full by the installment due date. U.S. Post Office cancellation mark is used as the date of payment receipt. Be aware that additional interest accrues on the unpaid balance on the first day of each month at the annual interest rate of $18 \\%$. Contact our office for the new total amount to redeem if making payment after the installment due date.\nINSTALLMENT PLAN The Installment Plan of Redemption (5-year plan) is a plan that allows a taxpayer the ability to pay defaulted taxes. It is strongly recommended that prior to applying for the Installment Plan of Redemption, you contact your lender/mortgage company to ensure they allow the payment plan to pay defaulted taxes. To successfully open an Installment Payment Plan of Redemption account you must pay: (1) All current year taxes that are already past-due and (2) a minimum payment of $20 \\%$ of the total delinquent tax amount including penalty and interest charges ( $1.5 \\%$ per month). Call our office to get the correct amount before sending payment. All subsequent taxes must be paid on or before April 10. If during the course of an installment plan the current taxes are not paid by April 10, the plan is in default.
