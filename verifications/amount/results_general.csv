Box 4930\n\nMiami Lakes, FL 33014-8500\nWe must hear from you no later than 60 days after we send you the first statement on which the error(s) or problems(s) appeared. You can telephone us but doing so will not preserve your rights.\n\nIn your letter give us the following information:\n\n- Your name and account number\n- The dollar amount of suspected error\n- Describe the error and explain if you can, why you believe there is an error. If you need more information, describe the item you are unsure about.\n\nYou do not have to pay any amount in question while we are investigating, but you are still obligated to pay the parts of your bill that are not in question. While we investigate your question, we cannot report you as delinquent or take any action to collect the amount you question.\n\nWe may report information about your account to credit bureaus. Late payments, missed payments or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report.\n\nNew York Borrowers: Popular Bank is regulated by the New York State Department of Financial Services (\""NYDFS\""). To file a complaint contact NYDFS Consumer Assistance Unit at 1-800-342-3736 or by visiting the NYDFS's website at www.dfs.ny.gov. Popular Bank may utilize a third-party service provider to service your loan but remains responsible for all actions taken by the third-party service provider.\n\n## Finance Charges\n\nFinance charges begin to accrue immediately when we make an advance to you. Popular Bank calculates the finance charges on your account by applying the daily rate noted on the front of the statement which corresponds to an ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE (\""APR\""), to the loan account balance each day. The daily periodic rate(s) is (are) determined by dividing the Annual Percentage Rate(s) applicable during the billing cycle by the number of days in the year.\n\nTo figure the finance charge for each day in a billing cycle, we multiply the daily periodic rate by the daily balance of your loan account balance on that day. We then add up those daily finance charges to figure the total finance charge for that billing cycle. To figure the daily balance, we first take your loan account balance at the beginning of each day, and add any new advances, and subtract any payments or credits that apply to debt repayment, and any unpaid finance charges, fees and charges. This gives us the daily balance.\n\n## Payment Information\n\nAll payments received by Popular Bank on any business day will be credited to your account as of the date such payment is received. Business days are days Popular Bank is open with the exception of Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays. Payments must be in U.S. Dollars.\n\n## Loan Payoff Information\n\nThe unpaid principal balance on your statement is not a payoff quote. You can request a payoff quote by using one of the following methods:\n\n- Call our Customer Care Center at 1-888-500-2612 between 7:30am and 9:00pm Eastern Time, Monday through Friday.\n- Visit your local Popular Bank Branch\n- Fax your request to 847-994-6489"",""temp_url"":null}","Document is a loan statement, not a typical invoice",true,POPULAR,,general,,1944695,COMMODORE BAY CONDOMINIUM ASSOCIATION,70070008583-00001,2024-08-01,5522.56,262.98,,POPULAR,4941.02,PO BOX 4503 OAK PARK IL 60303-4601,

Please be aware that all charges must be  |\n|   | paid each month to keep your account current and prevent collection activities. We  |\n|   | are required to inform you that certain charges such as your telephone line, and fees  |\n|   | and surcharges MUST be paid in order to prevent interruption of basic local  |\n|   | service. These charges are already included in the Total Amount Due and  |\n|   | are $914.27. Also, neglecting payment for other charges, such as long  |\n|   | distance, voice mail, InLine®, wireless, and Internet may result in those  |\n|   | services being interrupted.  |\n|   | LONG DIST. PROVIDERS  |\n|   | will have to show that you have selected AT&T Contt Services  |\n|   | or a company that resells their services as your primary local toll carrier and  |\n|   | that you have chosen not to select a long distance carrier. Please contact  |\n|   | us if this does not agree with your records.  |\n|   | FEES AND SURCHARGES  |\n|   | AT&T collects monthly fees and surcharges to help recover its required  |\n|   | contribution to government programs and to recover costs AT&T pays in taxes and  |\n|   | required payments levied by federal, state, and local governments. These fees and  |\n|   | surcharges included on your bill are periodically adjusted to align with the rates  |\n|   | determined by the government agency that is responsible for the state or federal  |\n|   | fund or tax and subject to change at any time without notice to you unless required  |\n|   | by law. For more information, please contact an AT&T Service Representative at  |\n|   | the phone number listed on the front of your bill.  |\n|   | COST ASSESSMENT CHRQ  |\n|   | AT&T charges you this monthly per line amount to recover its ongoing costs  |\n|   | incurred for property taxes and supporting the administration of local number  |\n|   | portability, a government program that enables customers to retain their telephone  |\n|   | number when changing service providers. This fee is not a tax or charge that the  |\n|   | government requires AT&T to collect from its customers.  |\n\n|  2024 AT&T Intellectual Property.

Future months' bill statements cover service periods which start and end on the same days of the month as the first service period. Charges associated with Pay-Per-View or On Demand purchases will be included on the next service period's bill statement.\n\nWhat happens if I have insufficient funds or a past due balance? Spectrum may charge a processing fee for any returned checks and card chargebacks. If your payment method is refused or returned for any reason, we may debit your account for the payment, plus an insufficient funds processing fee as described in your terms of service or video services rate card up to the amount allowable by law and any applicable tax. Your bank account may be debited as early as the same day your payment is refused or returned. If your bank account isn't debited, the return check amount (plus fee) must be paid by cash, cashier's check or money order.\n\n## What if I disagree with a charge?\n\nIf you want to dispute a charge, you have 60 days from the billing due date to file a complaint. While it's being reviewed, your service will remain active as long as you pay the undisputed part of your bill.\n\n## What if my service is interrupted?\n\nUnless prevented by situations beyond our control, services will be restored within 24 hours of you being notified.\n\nYou can find all of our terms and conditions at Spectrum.com/policies.\n\n## Descriptions\n\nTax and Fees - This statement reflects the current taxes and fees for your area (including sales, excise, user taxes, etc.). These taxes and fees may change without notice. Visit spectrum.net/taxesandfees for more information.\n\nTerms \\& Conditions - Spectrum's detailed standard terms and conditions for service are located at spectrum.com/policies.\n\nProgramming Changes - For information on any upcoming programming changes, please consult the Legal Notices published in your local newspaper and on spectrum.net/programmingnotices.\n\nSpectrum Terms and Conditions of Service - In accordance with the Spectrum Terms and Conditions of Service, Spectrum services are billed on a monthly basis. Spectrum does not provide credits for monthly subscription services that are cancelled prior to the end of the current billing month.\n\nAlternate Statement Formats - Alternative formats of Spanish, Spanish or English Braille and Spanish or English large print are available for future billing statements and customer communications, by request, and can be provided within 30 days of Spectrum's receipt of the request.

If your check, bankcard (debit or credit) charge, or other instrument or electronic transfer transaction used to pay us is dishonored, refused or returned for any reason, we may electronically debit your account for the payment, plus an insufficient funds processing fee as set forth in your terms of service or on your Video Services rate card (up to the amount allowable by law and any applicable sales tax). Your bank account may be debited as early as the same day payment is dishonored, refused or returned. If your bank account is not debited, the returned check amount (plus fee) must be replaced by cash, cashier's check or money order.\n\nPast Due Fee / Late Fee Reminder - To avoid a late fee, the BALANCE must be paid by the DUE DATE.

Paying by check authorizes Frontier to make a one-time electronic funds transfer from your account, as early as the day your check is received. When making an online payment, please allow time for the transfer of funds. If funds are received after the due date, you may be charged a fee, your service may be interrupted, and you may incur a reconnection charge to restore service. A fee may be charged for a bank returned check. Continued nonpayment of undisputed charges (incl. 900 and long distance charges) may result in collection action and a referral to credit reporting agencies, which may affect your credit rating.\n\n### IMPORTANT MESSAGES\n\nYou must pay all basic local service charges to avoid basic service disconnection. Failure to pay other charges will not cause disconnection of your basic service but this may cause other services to be terminated. Frontier Bundles may include charges for both basic and other services. Frontier periodically audits its bills to ensure accuracy which may result in a retroactive or future billing adjustment. Internet speed, if noted, is the maximum wired connection speed for selected tier; Wi-Fi speeds may vary; actual and average speed may be slower and depends on multiple factors. Performance details are at frontier.com/internetdisclosures.\n\n### SERVICE TERMS\n\nVisit frontier.com/terms, frontier.com/tariffs or call Customer Service for information on tariffs, price lists and other important Terms, Conditions and Policies (\""Terms\"") related to your voice, Internet and/or video services including limitations of liability, early termination fees, the effective date of and billing for the termination of service(s) and other important information about your rights and obligations, and ours. Frontier's Terms include a binding arbitration provision to resolve customer disputes (frontier.com/terms/arbitration). **Video and Internet services are subscription-based and are billed one full month in advance. Video and/or Internet service subscription cancellations and any early termination fees are effective on the last day of your Frontier billing cycle. No partial month credits or refunds will be provided for previously billed service subscriptions.** By using or paying for Frontier services, you are agreeing to these Terms and that disputes will be resolved by individual arbitration.
