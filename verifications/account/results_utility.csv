Your Tier 1/Baseline allowance provides for basic needs at an affordable price and encourages conservation. Your allowance is assigned based on the climate where you live, the season and your heat source. As you use more energy, you pay more for usage. Any usage over your baseline allowance will be charged at a higher price.\n\n**Wildfire Fund Charge:** Charge on behalf of the State of California Department of Water Resources (DWR) to fund the California Wildfire Fund. For usage prior to October 1, 2020, this charge included costs related to the 2001 California energy crisis, also collected on behalf of the DWR. These charges belong to DWR, not PG&E.\n\n\""PG&E\"" refers to Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a subsidiary of PG&E Corporation. © 2024 Pacific Gas and Electric Company.

'Above market' refers to the difference between what the utility pays for electric generation and current market prices for the sale of those resources. Visit www.pge.com/cca.\n\n**Wildfire Hardening Charge**: PG&E has been permitted to issue bonds that enable it to recover more quickly certain costs related to preventing and mitigating catastrophic wildfires, while reducing the total cost to its customers. Your bill for electric service includes a fixed recovery charge called the Wildfire Hardening Charge that has been approved by the CPUC to repay those bonds. The right to recover the Wildfire Hardening Charge has been transferred to a separate entity (called the Special Purpose Entity) that issued the bonds and does not belong to PG&E. PG&E is collecting the Wildfire Hardening Charge on behalf of the Special Purpose Entity. For details visit: www.pge.com/tariffs/assets/pdf/tariffbook/ELEC_PRELIM_IF.pdf.\n\n**Recovery Bond Charge/Credit**: Your bill for electric service includes a charge that has been approved by the CPUC to repay bonds issued for certain costs related to catastrophic wildfires. The Recovery Bond Charge (RBC) rate is currently $0.00597 per kWh. PG&E has also contributed certain amounts to a trust fund which is used to provide a customer credit equal to $0.00597 per kWh (Recovery Bond Credit). The right to recover the RBC has been transferred to one or more Special Purpose Entities that issued the bonds and does not belong to PG&E. PG&E is collecting that portion of the RBC on behalf of the Special Purpose Entities.\n\n**Gas Public Purpose Program (PPP) Surcharge**: Used to fund state-mandated gas assistance programs for low-income customers, energy efficiency programs, and public-interest research and development.\n\nVisit www.pge.com/billexplanation for more definitions.

Tier 1/Baseline allowance: Some residential rates are given a Tier 1/Baseline allowance - a CPUC approved percentage of average customer usage during summer and winter months. Your Tier 1/Baseline allowance provides for basic needs at an affordable price and encourages conservation. Your allowance is assigned based on the climate where you live, the season and your heat source. As you use more energy, you pay more for usage. Any usage over your baseline allowance will be charged at a higher price. Wildfire Fund Charge: Charge on behalf of the State of California Department of Water Resources (DWR) to fund the California Wildfire Fund. For usage prior to October 1, 2020, this charge included costs related to the 2001 California energy crisis, also collected on behalf of the DWR. These charges belong to DWR, not PG\\&E. \""PG\\&E\"" refers to Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a subsidiary of PG\\&E Corporation. (c) 2024 Pacific Gas and Electric Company. All rights reserved.

'Above market' refers to the difference between what the utility pays for electric generation and current market prices for the sale of those resources. Visit www.pge.com/cca. Wildfire Hardening Charge: PG\\&E has been permitted to issue bonds that enable it to recover more quickly certain costs related to preventing and mitigating catastrophic wildfires, while reducing the total cost to its customers. Your bill for electric service includes a fixed recovery charge called the Wildfire Hardening Charge that has been approved by the CPUC to repay those bonds. The right to recover the Wildfire Hardening Charge has been transferred to a separate entity (called the Special Purpose Entity) that issued the bonds and does not belong to PG\\&E. PG\\&E is collecting the Wildfire Hardening Charge on behalf of the Special Purpose Entity. For details visit: www.pge.com/tariffs/assets/pdf/tariffbook/ELEC_PRELIM_IF.pdf. Recovery Bond Charge/Credit: Your bill for electric service includes a charge that has been approved by the CPUC to repay bonds issued for certain costs related to catastrophic wildfires. The Recovery Bond Charge (RBC) rate is currently $\\$ 0.00597$ per kWh . PG\\&E has also contributed certain amounts to a trust fund which is used to provide a customer credit equal to $\\$ 0.00597$ per kWh (Recovery Bond Credit). The right to recover the RBC has been transferred to one or more Special Purpose Entities that issued the bonds and does not belong to PG\\&E. PG\\&E is collecting that portion of the RBC on behalf of the Special Purpose Entities. Gas Public Purpose Program (PPP) Surcharge. Used to fund state-mandated gas assistance programs for low-income customers, energy efficiency programs, and public-interest research and development.

If you believe there is an error on your bill, please call 1-800-743-5000 to speak with a representative. If you are not satisfied with our response, contact the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), Consumer Affairs Branch (CAB), 505 Van Ness Avenue, Room 2003, San Francisco, CA 94102, 1-800-649-7570 or 7-1-1 (8:30 AM to 4:30 PM, Monday through Friday) or by visiting www.cpuc.ca.gov/complaints/.\n\nTo avoid having service turned off while you wait for the outcome of a complaint to the CPUC specifically regarding the accuracy of your bill, please contact CAB for assistance.

You must continue to pay your current charges while your complaint is under review to keep your service turned on.\n\nIf you are not able to pay your bill, call PG&E to discuss how we can help. You may qualify for reduced rates under PG&E's CARE program or other special programs and agencies may be available to assist you. You may qualify for PG&E's Energy Savings Assistance Program which is an energy efficiency program for income-qualified residential customers.\n\n## Important definitions\n\nRotating outage blocks are subject to change without advance notice due to operational conditions.\n\n**Tier 1/Baseline allowance:** Some residential rates are given a Tier 1/Baseline allowance - a CPUC approved percentage of average customer usage during summer and winter months. Your Tier 1/Baseline allowance provides for basic needs at an affordable price and encourages conservation. Your allowance is assigned based on the climate where you live, the season and your heat source. As you use more energy, you pay more for usage. Any usage over your baseline allowance will be charged at a higher price.\n\n**Wildfire Fund Charge:** Charge on behalf of the State of California Department of Water Resources (DWR) to fund the California Wildfire Fund. For usage prior to October 1, 2020, this charge included costs related to the 2001 California energy crisis, also collected on behalf of the DWR. These charges belong to DWR, not PG&E.\n\n\""PG&E\"" refers to Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a subsidiary of PG&E Corporation. © 2024 Pacific Gas and Electric Company.

'Above market' refers to the difference between what the utility pays for electric generation and current market prices for the sale of those resources. Visit www.pge.com/cca.\n\n**Wildfire Hardening Charge**: PG&E has been permitted to issue bonds that enable it to recover more quickly certain costs related to preventing and mitigating catastrophic wildfires, while reducing the total cost to its customers. Your bill for electric service includes a fixed recovery charge called the Wildfire Hardening Charge that has been approved by the CPUC to repay those bonds. The right to recover the Wildfire Hardening Charge has been transferred to a separate entity (called the Special Purpose Entity) that issued the bonds and does not belong to PG&E. PG&E is collecting the Wildfire Hardening Charge on behalf of the Special Purpose Entity. For details visit: www.pge.com/fariffs/assets/pdf/fariffbook/ELEC_PRELIM_IF.pdf.\n\n**Recovery Bond Charge/Credit**: Your bill for electric service includes a charge that has been approved by the CPUC to repay bonds issued for certain costs related to catastrophic wildfires. The Recovery Bond Charge (RBC) rate is currently $0.00597 per kWh. PG&E has also contributed certain amounts to a trust fund which is used to provide a customer credit equal to $0.00597 per kWh (Recovery Bond Credit). The right to recover the RBC has been transferred to one or more Special Purpose Entities that issued the bonds and does not belong to PG&E. PG&E is collecting that portion of the RBC on behalf of the Special Purpose Entities.\n\n**Gas Public Purpose Program (PPP) Surcharge**: Used to fund state-mandated gas assistance programs for low-income customers, energy efficiency programs, and public-interest research and development.\n\nVisit www.pge.com/billexplanation for more definitions.

Tier 1/Baseline allowance: Some residential rates are given a Tier 1/Baseline allowance - a CPUC approved percentage of average customer usage during summer and winter months. Your Tier 1/Baseline allowance provides for basic needs at an affordable price and encourages conservation. Your allowance is assigned based on the climate where you live, the season and your heat source. As you use more energy, you pay more for usage. Any usage over your baseline allowance will be charged at a higher price. Wildfire Fund Charge: Charge on behalf of the State of California Department of Water Resources (DWR) to fund the California Wildfire Fund. For usage prior to October 1, 2020, this charge included costs related to the 2001 California energy crisis, also collected on behalf of the DWR. These charges belong to DWR, not PG\\&E. \""PG\\&E\"" refers to Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a subsidiary of PG\\&E Corporation. (c) 2024 Pacific Gas and Electric Company. All rights reserved.

'Above market' refers to the difference between what the utility pays for electric generation and current market prices for the sale of those resources. Visit www.pge.com/cca. Wildfire Hardening Charge: PG\\&E has been permitted to issue bonds that enable it to recover more quickly certain costs related to preventing and mitigating catastrophic wildfires, while reducing the total cost to its customers. Your bill for electric service includes a fixed recovery charge called the Wildfire Hardening Charge that has been approved by the CPUC to repay those bonds. The right to recover the Wildfire Hardening Charge has been transferred to a separate entity (called the Special Purpose Entity) that issued the bonds and does not belong to PG\\&E. PG\\&E is collecting the Wildfire Hardening Charge on behalf of the Special Purpose Entity. For details visit: www.pge.com/tariffs/assets/pdf/tariffbook/ELEC_PRELIM_IF.pdf. Recovery Bond Charge/Credit: Your bill for electric service includes a charge that has been approved by the CPUC to repay bonds issued for certain costs related to catastrophic wildfires. The Recovery Bond Charge (RBC) rate is currently $\\$ 0.00597$ per kWh . PG\\&E has also contributed certain amounts to a trust fund which is used to provide a customer credit equal to $\\$ 0.00597$ per kWh (Recovery Bond Credit). The right to recover the RBC has been transferred to one or more Special Purpose Entities that issued the bonds and does not belong to PG\\&E. PG\\&E is collecting that portion of the RBC on behalf of the Special Purpose Entities. Gas Public Purpose Program (PPP) Surcharge. Used to fund state-mandated gas assistance programs for low-income customers, energy efficiency programs, and public-interest research and development.

Demand is a measurement of the highest usage of electricity in any single fifteen (or sometimes five) minute period during a monthly billing cycle. Demand is measured in kilowatts (or kW). High demand is usually associated with equipment start-up. By spreading equipment start-ups over a longer period of time, you may be able to lower demand and reduce your demand charges.\n\nTime-of-use electric prices are higher every day during afternoons and evenings, and lower at other times of the day. Prices also change by season, with higher prices in the summer and lower prices in the winter.\n\nWildfire Fund Charge: Charge on behalf of the State of California Department of Water Resources (DWR) to fund the California Wildfire Fund. For usage prior to October 1, 2020, this charge included costs related to the 2001 California energy crisis, also collected on behalf of the DWR. These charges belong to DWR, not PG&E.\n\n|  Dijch vu khách tiếng Việt (Vietnamese) | 1-800-298-8438  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Business Customer Service | 1-800-468-4743  |\n\nPower Charge Indifference Adjustment (PCIA): The PCIA is a charge to ensure that both PG&E customers and those who have left PG&E service to purchase electricity from other providers pay for the above market costs for electric generation resources that were procured by PG&E on their behalf. 'Above market' refers to the difference between what the utility pays for electric generation and current market prices for the sale of those resources. Visit www.pge.com/cca.\n\nWildfire Hardening Charge: PG&E has been permitted to issue bonds that enable it to recover more quickly certain costs related to preventing and mitigating catastrophic wildfires, while reducing the total cost to its customers. Your bill for electric service includes a fixed recovery charge called the Wildfire Hardening Charge that has been approved by the CPUC to repay those bonds. The right to recover the Wildfire Hardening Charge has been transferred to a separate entity (called the Special Purpose Entity) that issued the bonds and does not belong to PG&E. PG&E is collecting the Wildfire Hardening Charge on behalf of the Special Purpose Entity. For details visit: www.pge.com/fariffs/assets/pdf/fariffbook/ELEC_PRELIM_IF.pdf.\n\nRecovery Bond Charge/Credit: Your bill for electric service includes a charge that has been approved by the CPUC to repay bonds issued for certain costs related to catastrophic wildfires. The Recovery Bond Charge (RBC) rate is currently $\\$ 0.00650$ per kWh. PG&E has also contributed certain amounts to a trust fund which is used to provide a customer credit equal to $\\$ 0.00650$ per kWh (Recovery Bond Credit). The right to recover the RBC has been transferred to one or more Special Purpose Entities that issued the bonds and does not belong to PG&E. PG&E is collecting that portion of the RBC on behalf of the Special Purpose Entities.\n\nGas Public Purpose Program (PPP) Surcharge. Used to fund state-mandated gas assistance programs for low-income customers, energy efficiency programs, and public-interest research and development.\n\nVisit www.pge.com/billexplanation for more definitions.

Demand charge: Many non-residential rates include a demand charge. Demand is a measurement of the highest usage of electricity in any single fifteen (or sometimes five) minute period during a monthly billing cycle. Demand is measured in kilowatts ( or kW ). High demand is usually associated with equipment start-up. By spreading equipment start-ups over a longer period of time, you may be able to lower demand and reduce your demand charges. Time-of-use electric prices are higher every day during afternoons and evenings, and lower at other times of the day. Prices also change by season, with higher prices in the summer and lower prices in the winter. Wildfire Fund Charge: Charge on behalf of the State of California Department of Water Resources (DWR) to fund the California Wildfire Fund. For usage prior to October 1, 2020, this charge included costs related to the 2001 California energy crisis, also collected on behalf of the DWR. These charges belong to DWR, not PG\\&E.\n\n|  Dijch vu khách tiếng Việt (Vietnamese) | $1-800-298-8438$  |\n| --- | --- |\n|  Business Customer Service | $1-800-468-4743$  |\n\nPower Charge Indifference Adjustment (PCIA): The PCIA is a charge to ensure that both PG\\&E customers and those who have left PG\\&E service to purchase electricity from other providers pay for the above market costs for electric generation resources that were procured by PG\\&E on their behalf. 'Above market' refers to the difference between what the utility pays for electric generation and current market prices for the sale of those resources. Visit www.pge.com/cca. Wildfire Hardening Charge: PG\\&E has been permitted to issue bonds that enable it to recover more quickly certain costs related to preventing and mitigating catastrophic wildfires, while reducing the total cost to its customers. Your bill for electric service includes a fixed recovery charge called the Wildfire Hardening Charge that has been approved by the CPUC to repay those bonds. The right to recover the Wildfire Hardening Charge has been transferred to a separate entity (called the Special Purpose Entity) that issued the bonds and does not belong to PG\\&E. PG\\&E is collecting the Wildfire Hardening Charge on behalf of the Special Purpose Entity. For details visit: www.pge.com/tariffs/assets/pdf/tariffbook/ELEC_PRELIM_IF.pdf. Recovery Bond Charge/Credit: Your bill for electric service includes a charge that has been approved by the CPUC to repay bonds issued for certain costs related to catastrophic wildfires. The Recovery Bond Charge (RBC) rate is currently $\\$ 0.00650$ per kWh . PG\\&E has also contributed certain amounts to a trust fund which is used to provide a customer credit equal to $\\$ 0.00650$ per kWh (Recovery Bond Credit). The right to recover the RBC has been transferred to one or more Special Purpose Entities that issued the bonds and does not belong to PG\\&E. PG\\&E is collecting that portion of the RBC on behalf of the Special Purpose Entities. Gas Public Purpose Program (PPP) Surcharge. Used to fund state-mandated gas assistance programs for low-income customers, energy efficiency programs, and public-interest research and development.

Your Tier 1/Baseline allowance provides for basic needs at an affordable price and encourages conservation. Your allowance is assigned based on the climate where you live, the season and your heat source. As you use more energy, you pay more for usage. Any usage over your baseline allowance will be charged at a higher price.\n\n**Wildfire Fund Charge:** Charge on behalf of the State of California Department of Water Resources (DWR) to fund the California Wildfire Fund. For usage prior to October 1, 2020, this charge included costs related to the 2001 California energy crisis, also collected on behalf of the DWR. These charges belong to DWR, not PG&E.\n\n*PG&E refers to Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a subsidiary of PG&E Corporation. © 2025 Pacific Gas and Electric Company.

If you are not satisfied with our response, contact the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC), Consumer Affairs Branch (CAB), 505 Van Ness Avenue, Room 2003, San Francisco, CA 94102, 1-800-649-7570 or 7-1-1 (8:30 AM to 4:30 PM, Monday through Friday) or by visiting www.cpuc.ca.gov/complaints/.\n\nTo avoid having service turned off while you wait for the outcome of a complaint to the CPUC specifically regarding the accuracy of your bill, please contact CAB for assistance. If your case meets the eligibility criteria, CAB will provide you with instructions on how to mail a check or money order to be impounded pending resolution of your case. You must continue to pay your current charges while your complaint is under review to keep your service turned on.\n\nIf you are not able to pay your bill, call PG&E to discuss how we can help. You may qualify for reduced rates under PG&E's CARE program or other special programs and agencies may be available to assist you. You may qualify for PG&E's Energy Savings Assistance Program which is an energy efficiency program for income-qualified residential customers.\n\n**Important definitions**\n\n**Rotating outage blocks** are subject to change without advance notice due to operational conditions.\n\n**Tier 1/Baseline allowance:** Some residential rates are given a Tier 1/Baseline allowance - a CPUC approved percentage of average customer usage during summer and winter months. Your Tier 1/Baseline allowance provides for basic needs at an affordable price and encourages conservation. Your allowance is assigned based on the climate where you live, the season and your heat source. As you use more energy, you pay more for usage. Any usage over your baseline allowance will be charged at a higher price.\n\n**Wildfire Fund Charge:** Charge on behalf of the State of California Department of Water Resources (DWR) to fund the California Wildfire Fund. For usage prior to October 1, 2020, this charge included costs related to the 2001 California energy crisis, also collected on behalf of the DWR. These charges belong to DWR, not PG&E.\n\n**Power Charge Indifference Adjustment (PCIA):** The PCIA is a charge to ensure that both PG&E customers and those who have left PG&E service to purchase electricity from other providers pay for the above market costs for electric generation resources that were procured by PG&E on their behalf. 'Above market' refers to the difference between what the utility pays for electric generation and current market prices for the sale of those resources. Visit www.pge.com/cca.\n\n**Wildfire Hardening Charge:** PG&E has been permitted to issue bonds that enable it to recover more quickly certain costs related to preventing and mitigating catastrophic wildfires, while reducing the total cost to its customers. Your bill for electric service includes a fixed recovery charge called the Wildfire Hardening Charge that has been approved by the CPUC to repay those bonds. The right to recover the Wildfire Hardening Charge has been transferred to a separate entity (called the Special Purpose Entity) that issued the bonds and does not belong to PG&E. PG&E is collecting the Wildfire Hardening Charge on behalf of the Special Purpose Entity. For details visit: www.pge.com/tariffs/assets/pdf/tariffbook/ELEC_PRELIM_JF.pdf.\n\n**Recovery Bond Charge/Credit:** Your bill for electric service includes a charge that has been approved by the CPUC to repay bonds issued for certain costs related to catastrophic wildfires. The Recovery Bond Charge (RBC) rate is currently $0.00650 per kWh. PG&E has also contributed certain amounts to a trust fund which is used to provide a customer credit equal to $0.00650 per kWh (Recovery Bond Credit). The right to recover the RBC has been transferred to one or more Special Purpose Entities that issued the bonds and does not belong to PG&E. PG&E is collecting that portion of the RBC on behalf of the Special Purpose Entities.\n\n**Gas Public Purpose Program (PPP) Surcharge:** Used to fund state-mandated gas assistance programs for low-income customers, energy efficiency programs, and public-interest research and development.\n\nVisit www.pge.com/billexplanation for more definitions.
